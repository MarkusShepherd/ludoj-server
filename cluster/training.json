                    "description": "Sink the Biz (originally \"Sink the Bismark\") is a dexterity game traditionally played at Nick's English Hut in Bloomington, IN.\n\nThe game is played using a metal bucket filled with beer, with a small weighted juice glass (the \"Biz\") floating in it. The bucket is placed in the middle of the table, within easy reach of all players. Each player has a glass filled with the same type beer that is in the bucket. Players take turns pouring small amounts of their beer inside the floating glass. Usually players agree on a minimum height from which the beer must be poured into the Biz. Also, it is generally acknowledged that just a drop or two of beer are not enough to satisfy one's turn requirement. In case of any ambiguity in this sense, all the other players vote to decide whether or not a pour was enough. If it is decided that the active player did not pour the minimum amount, the active player must pour again before his turn is over.\n\nThe player who sinks the Biz must recover it from the bucket and drink all of its content. After that, the Biz is placed back in the bucket, players' glasses are refilled, and the process is repeated. Players may drop out of the game at any time. The game is over when only one player remains in the game. That player is the winner.\n\nThe game allows for limited strategic decisions. The main strategy is to fill the Biz as much as possible during one's turn, to make it more likely for the next player to sink the Biz. This is, however, a calculated risk, as the player attempting this technique may end up pouring too much beer and sinking the Biz as a result.",

                    "description": "Raiders of the North Sea is set in the central years of the Viking Age. As Viking warriors, players seek to impress the Chieftain by raiding unsuspecting settlements. Players will need to assemble a crew, collect provisions and journey north to plunder gold, iron and livestock. There is glory to be found in battle, even at the hands of the Valkyrie. So gather your warriors, it\u2019s raiding season!\n\n\nAim of the Game\n\nThe aim of Raiders of the North Sea is to impress the Chieftain by having the most Victory Points (VP) at the game\u2019s end. Victory Points are gained primarily by raiding Settlements, taking Plunder and making Offerings to the Chieftain. How players use their Plunder is also vital to their success. The game ends when either only 1 Fortress raid remains, all Valkyrie are removed, or all Offerings have been made.\n\n\n\nGameplay Overview\n\nProceeding clockwise from the starting player, each player takes his turn in full. On his turn, a player may choose to Work or Raid. Players continue to take turns until 1 of the 3 end-game conditions has been met. Regardless of choices, each turn follows the same pattern:\n\n1. Place Worker and resolve its action\n2. Pick up a different Worker and resolve its action\n\nWorking\nHaving a good Crew and enough provisions are vital to successful raiding. So before making any raids, players will need to do some work to prepare their Crew and collect supplies. This is all done in the Village, at the bottom of the board. There are 8 different buildings, with various actions. Players must first place their one and only Worker in an available building (where there is no Worker present), before picking up a different Worker from a different building (where there is a Worker present).\n\nRaiding\nOnce players have hired enough Crew and collected Provisions, they may choose to raid on their turn. To raid a Settlement (Harbour, Outpost, Monastery or Fortress), players need to meet 3 requirements. They must have:\n\n1. A large enough Crew.\n2. Enough Provisions (and Gold for Monasteries/Fortresses).\n3. The required Worker colour.\n\nRaiding offers various ways of scoring (Military Strength, Plunder, Valkyrie, etc.). This is also how Grey and White Workers enter the game.\n\n\nEnd of the Game\n\nThere are 3 ways the game can end:\n\n1. There is only 1 set of Plunder left in the Fortresses (1 of the 6 Fortress raids remains).\n2. The Offering Draw Pile has been emptied.\n3. There are no Valkyrie left on the board.",

The Villagers don't know who the Werewolves are, and the Werewolves are trying to remain undiscovered while they slowly eliminate the Villagers one at a time. A Moderator (who isn't on a team) runs the game.\n\nUltimate Werewolf takes place over a series of game days and nights. Each day, the players discuss who among them is a Werewolf and vote out a player. Each night, the Werewolves choose a player to eliminate, while the Seer learns whether one player is a Werewolf or not. The game is over when either all the Villagers or all the Werewolves are eliminated.\n\nUltimate Werewolf: Deluxe Edition features all new artwork, a great new design, totally rewritten and more comprehensive rules, and an even better moderator scorepad. What's more, it supports more players than ever: 75 of your closest friends can converge on one or more villages using the components in this box.\n\nUltimate Werewolf: Deluxe Edition For Kickstarter adds 20 bonus cards unlocked during the Kickstarter campaign beyond the retail deluxe edition - Deluxe Edition versions of all the existing Ultimate Werewolf expansions to date (except Artifacts), including the new Wolf Pack cards. It also included a deeper box that allows the cards to be stood on their side.",

                    "description": "Labyrinth of Minotaur [Minotauros] is an ancient board game.\n\nThis is a real ancient game from ancient Crete with boards found dating to about 1.000 B.C.\n\nThere are many boards, with Labyrinths on them.\n\nThere are 2-4 players. Each player has seven pawns. Pawns must have the signs of Minos era.\n\nAlso there are three dice with ancient Greek shapes on them.\n\nThe player with the highest die roll plays first. All pawns must enter the board make a run and then return to the beginning. The players chose the board.\nBoards can be on a big board on both sides. Player who manages to exit all his pawns is the winner. Each square has its own sign; each sign has a command to do (i.e. go 10 spaces, back 5 spaces etc).\nSo the board game has the following items:\n1. Some Colored Boards with Labyrinths.\n2. Seven pawns different in color and shape for each of the four players.\n3. Three dice with different shapes each one.\n4. Many other items.\nOf course there is a 32-page leaflet with some information for this game with many photos from ancient Crete and from Greece. (The island of Deus)",

                    "description": "Knights of the Rainbow is from FX Schmid USA. The box rates the game for 2-6, the rules rate it for 2-4, and the body of the rules refer to a maximum of five players. It is recommended that players stay within the 2-4 range, where 3 players seems ideal, otherwise the benefits of the honor cards (see below) are far too strong.\n\nPlayers start with seven strength, two gold, and no cards. On each turn a player can flip one, two, or three cards from the deck, keeping one of them and discarding the rest. All of a player\u2019s cards are kept face-up, stacked by type so everyone can see them.\n\nPlayers win by knocking out all opponents or having the highest score after three passes through the deck. Most of the cards are distributed among five color-coded types: strength, force, gold, magic, and honor. The player with the most cards of each type gains an advantage, usually at the start of his turn. The simplest of these increase a player\u2019s strength or gold, or decrease other players\u2019 strength. The leader in magic can trade any of his cards for any card from the discard pile, or sacrifice any one of his own cards to destroy an opponent\u2019s card.\n\nHonor works differently. Shuffled into the deck are four \u201cKing\u2019s Favor\u201d cards. When one of these is turned up, the player with the most honor gets two gold, two strength, or the top card from the deck. Misfortune cards are the dark side of the same coin, forcing loss of gold, strength, or cards from all players. Many cards bear a rainbow icon, however, and the player showing the most rainbows at the top of their stacks is protected from Misfortune.\n\nA player can spend gold at the end of his turn to buy another card from the deck, decrease an opponent\u2019s strength, or trade cards with an opponent. A player losing his last strength is knocked out of the game. Anyone who survives to the third appearance of the Long Live the King card (which triggers a reshuffle) scores a point for each magic card, strength, and gold they have. The highest total wins.",

Interesting game mechanics (for a card game) that balance well tactical decisions and strategic elements.\n\nThe game represents battle between two armies, including Space Marines, Chaos, Eldar, Orks etc. for the conquest of an objective planet divided in 5 different strategic sectors.\n\nA card represents: army units, actions to play during battle, and a die roll, all included in a single card depending on when and where it is played.\n\nEvery expansion has a new planet to conquer with 5 new sectors that change completely the approach with which a player can try to win, so players are encouraged to change deck and test different strategies to adapt in the new terrain of battle.",

Because you can add a letter without knowing a word that actually contains the created fragment. As long as the next player doesn't challenge the fragment, you are safe. Players score a point for successfully adding the last letter that fits into a frame and for winning a challenge.\n\nThe challenge: Choose one of the frames and ask the previous player to name a word that contains the respective fragment (in the exact order of the letters). If they can, they win a point; if not, you do.\n\nThe game ends in a \"best of three\", which means that whoever scores the second point wins.",

Each expansion set features four heroes and four villains. The game pulls these heroes and villains from a pool of thousands of classic movies and TV shows. We have archive licenses to use characters from multiple film libraries. We are also in negotiations with many rightsholders to continuously add new licenses. Fight Klub is never static. It's always evolving. Players suggest licenses and vote on which characters they want to bring into Fight Klub. If we don't have a particular license, we will try to get it. The possibilities are endless.\n\nFight Klub games play very quickly... in about fifteen minutes. Fight. Rinse. Repeat. Any deck can play any deck:\n\n* Good vs. Evil\n* Evil vs. Evil\n* Good vs. Good\n\nFight Klub was created by members of the same team of award-winning designers who brought you Star Trek, Star Wars, and Lord of the Rings.

Each turn a player rolls five dice and tries to advance along a linear track which marks the players score. To win, players must land on the \"1200 points\" space exactly.\n\nFour dice are numbered 1-5 and 10, and the fifth is a \"wild\" dice, which has at least one side labeled \"wild.\" Points are scored for rolling 5's and 10's, and also for rolling straights, three of a kind etc., in a similar manner to Yahtzee. After rolling players have the option of holding scoring dice (5's or 10's) or rolling.\n\nHowever if a non-scoring combination is rolled, players lose points rolled in the current round.\n\nThe score track also features way stations, which earn the players \"Opportunity points.\"",

Dice on the Inside track move the number of spaces rolled and try to get back to the Outside track. Dice on the Outside track have more interesting movement options -- (a) move the number rolled, (b) roll 2,3,4,5 and move to that space on the Outside track if it is empty, (c) match a number showing on an opponents dice and take it's place while moving it to the Inside track, (d) roll one less than a number showing on another dice and move to the space just in front of that dice, (e) roll one more than a a number showing on another dice and move to the space just behind that dice. Any move that causes one to land on an opponent's dice, moves that dice to the Inside track.\nThe game goal is to land one's dice on one's GOAL space on the Oustside track. Each time a player scores a goal, he moves the scoring cube one stage on the scoring track towards his High Stage. The scoring track is in the shape of an X. The four tips of the X are the High Stage for each player. The center of the X is the Zero Stage. If another player scores first, a second scoring player would move the scoring cube back to the Zero Stage. From the Zero Stage, a player would win by scoring 3 consecutive goals.\nThere is also a short version of the game where the scoring cube is not used and the first player to 3 goals wins.",

Shuffle the 16-card orangutan deck, then lay out 4 or 5 cards face up, depending on the number of players; each orangutan shows one or more suit cards on it, and a player must possess matching cards to claim that orangutan.\n\nEach round, the lead player lays a card on the table, then each player follows, without regard for suit. Whoever played the highest card claims one card played by another player, then either places it on the table before her or uses it (possibly with cards collected earlier) to claim an orangutan. The player discards all cards needed to claim the orangutan, and tucks any remaining cards collected under that orangutan.\n\nEach player must claim one card, if possible, adding it to her collected cards or claiming an orangutan. Discard any unclaimed card. After all players are finished, lay out new orangutan cards (if needed), then play another round.\n\nOnce players have played all ten cards in hand, the game ends. Each player sums the points on the orangutan cards she claimed, then loses one point for each excess card tucked or collected card still on the table. The player with the highest score wins.\n\nAll profits from sales of Old Men of the Forest will be donated to the Orangutan Foundation UK.",

The catch is that the square tiles, which are sectioned off into 4 triangular sections with different colors, must match colors with the side of the square(s) it is being placed next to. In addition, the tiles must stay in a 5x5 grid and cannot be placed so that the grid would be larger than 5x5. The first person to place all 12 twelve of their tiles (or has placed the most if neither player can legally place more) is the winner.

In each round, players lay out knights before them who have different strength values. The color of the knight symbolizes the country one wants to conquer. If one lays down further knights of the same color in later rounds, they will be arranged in a row below each other. It is important that only one knight per color may be part of the conquering squad.\n\nTo conquer a country, one needs a knight with a higher strength number as the one defending it. Once a country has been conquered, the former owner receives his or her knight cards back. However, the other players will try to conquer the country anew by laying down knights with higher overall strength. They also must bear in mind the different special functions of each country. Most countries serve as income sources; some enable the player to enforce his defense troops and so on.\n\nAt the end of the game, you will receive a \u201cgeneral rating.\u201d The player owning a country receives the sum of his defense knight\u2019s value points in that country. Cards that have not been used will earn minus points. The player who now owns the highest amount of money wins the game and becomes the new king!",

Actions are performed on a points basis, so a character could run forward and fire a few badly-aimed shots, or stand still and fire more rounds at a target.\n\nThe game contains a large amount of detail concerning combat and psychological effects.\n\nRules for purchasing and trading equipment for players' gangs, were also included.\n\nThe game appears to be the precursor of Necromunda, published five years later.",

One player can move the pawns along columns, while the other moves them along rows. Players cannot move the same pawn they moved the previous turn, so strategy is built around knowing which choices your opponent has next, and working to make those choices miserable \u2014 thus putting them in a dilemma. Some of the tiles affect the board when collected: moving tiles or pawns, returning pieces to the board, or stealing tiles from an opponent. When neither player can move, the game ends and whoever has the most points wins.\n\nSkillful maneuvering and forethought are the name of the game in this engaging, classical board game.",

The gameplay is reminiscent of games like Parcheesi or Patolli: players have got to throw pebbles and then use the outcome of the throw to move their stones along a closed track. The goal is to bring their pieces home first - pieces of the opponents can be taken on the way and so get sent back to their home square.\n\nYucatan, though, has got some interesting additions to make it more tactical than the average race game: it is best played by partnerships of two, who can under certain circumstances move the partner's pieces; a cross within the track allows the pieces to take shortcuts, and similar pieces can be stacked and moved as a unit.",

Depending on the outcome of the subsequent check, either the doubter or the player who put down the previous card is \"punished\" with additional hand cards.\nThe goal of the game is to get rid of your hand cards as soon as possible.\n\nThere are quite a few games in the Anno Domini series, each dealing with a different topic ranging from \"Inventions\" over \"Art\" or \"Coins\" to different geographic regions (e.g. Germany, America or now Europe). Even a SdJ edition exists!\n\nEach game consists of 336 cards and can be played stand-alone or mixed together with some or all of the other editions.",

This continues until one player is satisfied with the mix achieved in his/her 7-card hand and calls \"Snap.\" At that point, the \"hot phase\" begins, with players slapping cards at will - although one at a time - on the discard pile. When two cards with with matching color are placed one over the other, that suit becomes the winning suit. Players then score points for cards of that color in their hand. Players also score for all other cards of any color with numbers matching their winning-suit cards remaining in other players' hands (except for cards valued 10 and above).

The center of the board has an outline map of the United States with the Electoral College votes of each state marked. The map divides the states into six color-coded regions.\n\nPlayers move around the edge of the board on a 64-square track. Most of these are individual states, and landing on one allows a player to take the state if uncommitted or to contest it if held by another player. To contest, he rolls 2D6, and on a 2-6 wins the state, while on 7-12 the challenged party gets to take a state in the same region from a challenger.\n\nThere is a deck of Political Fortune cards which are collected on eight of the spaces. These can be positive or negative: losing a state or a turn or even all states in a region; or winning states and becoming a \"favorite son\" in a state, which confers unchallengeable ownership of that state for the rest of the game.\n\nWhen a player collects the majority of the states in one of the six regions, he takes over all the electoral college votes for the region and all of those states are locked (can no longer be challenged). First player to 270 Electoral College votes wins.",

The player to the left of the dealer begins by placing one card face down onto the centre of the table and names its picture, for example saying \"flower\". The next player puts a card on top of it also saying \"flower\", this is when the bluffing comes in. Each player in his turn has to claim to lay the same picture as that which was started with whether he has one or not. Play continues in this way until the call comes back to the player who started the round. He calls again the name of the picture he started with and lays a card. This is the end of that round. The next player starts a new round by placing a card on top of the cards already on the table (if any) and names the same or a different picture.\nAny time a player thinks another player is bluffing he may challenge him. If he is in fact bluffing and has not laid the card he said, he has to pick up all the cards on the table and add them to his hand. If he was not bluffing the challenger has to pick up all the cards.",

Each turn, a set of colored chips are auctioned off for each player, however, the number of chips and color combinations are different. Players simultaneously bid some of their bankroll to determine what order they'll pick their set. Once all the chips have been awarded, players can cash in sets of chips for the values on cards which change every turn.

                    "description": "Plants grow, flower and wilt away as they produce seeds for the next year.\n\nFlora is a quick and simple game played through four short seasons. During Winter, the game is set up. During Spring, players add tiles into an empty play area to form an initial group in any shape. During Summer, the group changes and grows as the players add two tiles and take one away each turn. The first gist of the game is that all these three actions must be used on different colours. Finally during Autumn, only one player takes a single tile and the game ends.\n\nThe second gist is that at the end of the game, the value of a collected tile is based on the tiles remaining in the group: multiple small, separate areas of the same colour make it valuable, but many of them might vanish or be easily connected into one large area, resulting in lots of negative points. Players also have control over the game's length and Autumn can arrive unexpectedly.\n\nThe basic two-player game has no structural hidden elements, it consists only of 11 red tiles, 13 blue tiles and 15 yellow tiles, and the rules are easily adaptable for thematic additions and personal variants.",

The Castle of each player sits in the nearest right corner of the board.\nThe first player that captures an adversary Castle (or conquers the last piece of one colour) wins , thus ending game.\n\nTurn action: movement and capture\n\nOn his turn, a player can move one of his square-shaped pieces. All the pieces (but the Castle, which as said before can not be moved) are equal to each other. Each of them can move in 4 diferent ways, according to the side of the piece facing \u201cnorth\u201d, north being defined as \u201cforward\u201d from the POV of the owner of the piece. So for example \u201cnorth\u201d for the player sitting on the east side of table will be westward, wile for the player sitting on the north side of the table it will be southward, and so on.\n\nOn his turn the player can move one of his pieces in one of these\n2 ways:\n- just rotate the piece in place (thus changing the piece movement\ntype for the next time he will decide to move it);\n- move the piece and then (optionally) rotate it;\n\nA player can capture other players' pieces by moving one of his piece on a square occupied by an opponent's piece. Pieces can never \u201cgo through\u201d or \u201cjump over\u201d other pieces, both of the same or different colours.\n\nEach piece can be oriented in four different ways (one per each side of the piece) enabling it to four different kind of movement.\n\nThe active roles is the one facing \u201cnorth\u201d.\n\nThese are the four roles a piece can assume:\n\n- Warrior:\nit moves 1 square and can't go backwards, in other words it can\nmove to one of the 5 squares adjacent to it (W, NW, N, NE, E);\n- Blade:\nit moves 1 or 2 square \u201cforward\u201d (N);\n- Catapult:\nit can move up to 3 squares diagonally going only forward, as\nusual (NE, NW);\n- Shield:\nthe only role that can go backwards, it can move up to 2 squares\ngoing South or just 1 square going diagonally (SW or SE).\n\nBegining of the game\n\nThe first player to move will be the one opening the table. Then it will be the player on his left the one to move, and so on, going clockwise.\n\nWe advise you not to distract from what the other players do: you can lose the game even if an enemy don't conquer your Castle (one wins, all others lose).",

Great nations protect and provide for their own, while fighting and competing against both other nations and nature itself. Nations must provide food as the population increases, build a productive economy, and amaze the world with their great achievements to build up their heritage as the greatest nations in the history of mankind!\n\nNations: The Dice Game is a game for 1-4 players that takes 10-15 minutes per player and shares many concepts with the civilization-building game Nations while still offering its own challenges. The game is played over four ages (four rounds). During each round, players take turns until all have passed. The available actions are:\n\n\nBuy a tile\nBuild a wonder\nReroll some or all your dice\n\n\nBuildings and military provide dice. Colonies and wonders provide resources and victory points. Advisors provide rerolls. New tiles provide benefits immediately, so you can roll new dice at once.\n\nAt the end of each round, War and Famine drawn at the start of the round is checked for each player, giving you victory points if you match or beat the values. Books are accumulated and scored. Player order is checked, with high military strength going first in the next round. At the end of the game, whoever has the most victory points wins.",

Each turn, the active player rolls a die and moves one of the adventurers further away from the dragon. After all of the adventurers have moved once, all of them are available for movement once again. Don't be too obvious about which adventurers you support, though, for others will drop traps in their path or otherwise hobble them to ensure that they become dragon food first.\n\nAt the end of a round, players score points based on how far their adventurers traveled, and after two rounds the player with the most points wins.",

Unheilvoll und grimmig liegt sie auf der Klippe von Kyrm.In den D\u00f6rfern, die sich in ihrem Schatten dr\u00e4ngen, fl\u00fcstert man Geschichten von den unerme\u00dflichen Sch\u00e4tzen, die die Verliese, Kammern und Korridore des Schlosses f\u00fcllen und von den grausigen Kreaturen, die sie bewachen. Alte M\u00e4nner r\u00fccken n\u00e4her ans Feuer, wenn sie von den Lauten erz\u00e4hlen, die in der Nacht von der Klippe herab durch das Tal hallen, so als schiene das Kastell - zum Leben erwacht - seine Grausamkeit zu verk\u00fcnden. Wenige kehrten vor der Abendd\u00e4mmerung zur\u00fcck, in ihren Augen Schrecken und Qual, und nur mit Widerwillen berichteten sie von ihren Erlebnissen. Doch niemand kam jemals nach Einbruch der Nacht zur\u00fcck...Das rotgoldene Licht der Morgensonne beginnt sich \u00fcber den Herbstnebel zu erheben. Ihre Augen blicken auf die schimmernde Festung. Im Kopf eines jeden von Ihnen kreisen noch die Geschichten der D\u00f6rfler, doch Sie packen ihre Waffen und treten in das endlose Schwarz der Eing\u00e4nge. Untergang oder Reichtum? Die Zeit wird es lehren...Sie spielen einen jener mutigen Helden, die den Schrecken der Drachenhortfeste zu trotzen wagen. Ihre Aufgabe ist es, die Drachenhortfeste zu betreten und Ihren Weg durch die G\u00e4nge und Verliese zur Schatzkammer in der Mitte zu finden und wieder zu entkommen. Sie m\u00fcssen entkommen, bevor die Sonne versinkt, denn nach Sonenuntergang werden die Bewohner der Drachenhortfeste \u00fcberm\u00e4chtig und kein Sterblicher wird dann \u00fcberleben. Doch auch tags\u00fcber sind die G\u00e4nge und Katakomben mit ihren blinden Korridoren, ihren Monstern, Fallen und - zu guter Letzt - dem Drachen, der den Schatz bewacht, \u00e4u\u00dferst gef\u00e4hrlich.",

Coins are scored for gem tiles on the mines you have claimed, with bonuses for dynamite tiles \u2014 but if there is too much dynamite, the mine (and all the riches within) are destroyed!\n\nIn more detail, players sit around a circle composed of cave game boards and the guildhall game board, with sixty mining tiles placed face-down within this circle. Each round, while playing at the same time, players use one hand to look at one mining tile at a time, then place it on one of the cave game boards. At any time, a player can claim the guildhall or a cave by placing one of their three goblins on the board, after which no more tiles or goblins may be placed on this board.\n\nOnce everyone has placed all of their goblins (or decided not to place them), players resolve the boards. The goblin on the guildhall draws a minion card that provides a special ability, while each goblin in a cave scores coins based on the gems, diamonds, dynamite and monsters found there; these goblins can also take minion cards if minion tiles have been placed in the cave. Dynamite multiplies the value of a cave, but three or more sticks blows the place up, costing you coins.\n\nIf someone has one hundred or more coins, the game ends and whoever has the most coins wins; if not, set up another round and go digging again.",

The aim of the game is to collect the most points by assembling the strongest rebel team after two rounds.\n44 tiles (4 of each rebels and 8 showing Kylo Ren) are revealed one by one from the middle of the table (where the tiles are laid face-down as the set-up). Players may collect these tiles on their planets (3/4/6 in a 4/3/2-player game) simply by hitting on the rebel symbol when they decide they want the exposed tiles, after which they put the tiles on one of their planets. The process continues until all planets are full or all the tiles are revealed.\n\n9 rebels (valued 1 to 5) and Kylo Ren (valued -5) can be collected by players who have the majority of tiles of the corresponding tile type. Characters with unresolved ties remain in the middle.\n\nA second round is played in a similar fashion; tied characters remain in the middle or at the players who collected them in the first round. The player with the most points wins.\n\n(The mechanism is a reimplementation of SWAT! but the scoring is completely different.)",

                    "description": "City building has never been so easy: Just roll the dice, then build a building. However, each die must be selected carefully to fit the building requirements. Push your luck too far \u2013 or select carelessly \u2013 and a player may find himself demolishing his city instead of building it up. Choose each die wisely and build efficiently in order to erect magnificent skyscrapers and create the best skyline!\n\nSkyline is a quick push-your-luck dice game involving set collection. Unlike other dice games that provide no relationship from turn to turn and no player interaction, this game allows players to literally build upon their decisions each turn and react to their opponents' actions.\n\nEach turn, players choose to roll dice from either the Construction Yard or the Abandoned District, with the goal of erecting urban buildings. Buildings are made up of three types of dice: Ground Floor dice, Mid-Floor dice and Penthouse dice. Some buildings are safer to build but provide little reward, while other buildings have poor probabilities but can have substantial impact on the success of a player's skyline.\n\nAfter rolling their selected dice, the player must use at least one of these dice to take one of three possible actions: Abandon, Build, or Cancel Construction. The Build action is the desired outcome, of course, but can be carried out only if the die result matches what they need to build. For instance, all Ground Floor dice can be built without restriction, but a High-Rise Mid-Floor die result can be built only on top of a High-Rise Ground Floor die. Likewise, a Mid-Rise Penthouse die can be built only on a Mid-Rise Mid-Floor die. If the rolled results do not allow them to Build, then the player must Cancel Construction on one of their existing buildings. If a player does not want to Cancel Construction, then they must Abandon by placing that die in the Abandoned District, which gives their opponents the opportunity to capitalize on this failure.\n\nAt the end of the game, points are rewarded for completed buildings according to their height. A Level 3 building \u2013 that is, a building comprised of three dice \u2013 is worth 9 points, while a Level 4 building is worth 16, and so on.\n\nRemember, the dice control the results...but the players control the dice.",

The goal is to create patterns of 4 beads along any \"line\" either horizontally or in a stair-step pattern. The line can be along the outside of the circle, along one of the two straight lines, or along one of the arcs. A line along an arc in a stair-step pattern is called a \"helix.\"\n\nAfter all 48 beads have been played, the game is scored as follows:\n\n1 point for each line of 4 beads\n1 bonus point for the first line of 4 beads\n2 points for each line of 5 beads\n\nThe player with the highest total score is the winner.\n\nThe game can also be played as a partnership game with partners sitting across from each other and sharing a color.\n\nSimilar to:\n\nScore Four",

The presentation is minimalist: a blank hex sheet and one page of rules. Players must improvise their own counters!\n\nLike its successor, the game depicts combat between spaceships. Each ship is represented by a series of letters,with each letter representing a system (shields, engines, several types of beam weapon, torpedoes, guns, etc.). In each turn, ships fire their weapons, then move. The probability of a hit depends upon range. A hit destroys one of the target's systems, gradually reducing its firepower, defenses and speed. Movement is simply a number of hexes equal to the number of engine systems - no momentum or other complications of physics.\n\nThere are three scenarios: \"Main Battle Fleet\", \"Convoy Action\" and \"Planet Assault\". Terrain, in the form of radiation belts or asteroids, may be added in the players' discretion.\n\nRe-implemented by:\n\nStarfire",

What sets the game apart from other games in the tile-laying genre is that the cards can be placed almost anywhere on the board and in almost any orientation. Cards may touch at corners, and the corner of one card may touch the side of another.\n\nPlayers advance by purchasing stores formed by the cards and collecting revenue from those stores at the beginning of each subsequent turn. Symbols on cards may trigger effects when drawn, either destroying or emptying the largest store, or giving players bonus payouts.\n\nVictory is achieved by the first player to reach 50 points.\n\nSince revenue comes from the quality of your store, but other players can play tiles to alter that store, the overall result is a cutthroat mind-bender, making it one of the most popular games of Cheapass's Hip Pocket Games series. The game was originally released as Agora in 2002, with the theme of an ancient Greek marketplace.",

The object of the game is for one Country to accumulate as much wealth, land, and prestige (in the form of actual discoveries) as he[sic] can; the Country with the greatest total of all three is the victor.\" (from SPI game rules introduction)\n\nOriginally published in 1976 by SPI in Strategy & Tactics magazine #58, and later sold as a boxed edition in a plastic tray, the SPI version is a one to three player game, featuring the Spanish (green counters), French (blue counters), and English (beige counters). Rules for Portugal or the German bankers as a fourth player are included, but no counters are provided in the game.\n\nThe Avalon Hill edition is a one to four player game, featuring the Spanish (green counters), French (blue counters), English (pink counters) and Portuguese (yellow counters). This edition of the game was published in 1982 with a mounted map in a bookcase box. The \"Fur Traders & Buccaneers\" variant in The GENERAL Vol.21 No.5 added counters and rules for Dutch, Danish, and slave units.\n\nDeveloper: Greg Costikyan",

(Quanto has 110 cards, with one copy less of each card.) Each player starts with a hand of four cards, and four cards are laid face up on the table. On a turn, a player takes one of three actions:\n\n\nLay down one card, then collect all cards of the same number (including the one played) and two or more cards that sum to this number, placing all of these cards in a personal score pile.\nCreate a \"build\" (a.k.a. \"Quanto\") by laying down a card, taking one other card from the display, placing them to your side, then taking the matching number tile to mark this build; you can take two or more cards at the same time that sum to this value and place them in your build. In the future, you can play a card of this value to possibly add more cards to the build, then move all of these cards to your score pile.\nDiscard a card to the face up display. If you discard a 1, each opponent must give you a card from her score pile; if you discard a 2, you play a second card from your hand, once again taking any of the three actions; if you discard a 3, you reveal three cards from the deck, use one to perform an action, then discard the other two.\n\n\nAfter taking an action, you refill the face-up display to four cards and your hand to four cards. If you use a rainbow card for action 1, you can claim another face-up card of your choice; if you use one for action 3, then you add an additional card to the display.\n\nWhen the deck runs out and all players have emptied their hands, the game ends and whoever has the most cards wins.\n\nSloop includes partnership rules that allow partners to add to (but not claim) one another's builds and to swap cards with one another during play.",

This tomb was to become known as the \"stepped pyramid\", the first of the great pyramids of Egypt.\n\nEach player is a builder vying to add to their wealth through this grand project. The builders secure the services of some of the kingdom's artisans to supply finished stone for the pyramid and food for their workers. They then use these tiles to build the pyramid and are rewarded for their efforts by the treasury.\n\nBut building the pyramid is not the only way to gain wealth. There is a thriving market for the stone and food required to build the pyramid. There are profits to be made by selling goods on the open market and at times, tiles purchased on the market may let you build when you would not otherwise be able to do so. By deploying influential members of your family, you can also gain advantage in various aspects of your business dealings.\n\nUse your money and influence wisely and the completion of the pyramid will see you take your rightful place as the kingdom's most successful builder.\"",

The game is mainly based on trick-taking mechanisms, with each trick representing a local struggle to control a country in the world. The world is composed of a vast number of countries, each one represented by a tile on the table. Each country also has its own defensive attributes: a certain military strength, economic strength and political strength which need to be overcome. In order to win, your alliance has to dominate the world by gaining control over the most countries.\n\nAlliances includes three different games in one box:\n\n\nFor 2 players, a confrontational trick taking game.\nFor 3 players, a game in which each player in turn plays a superpower empire while the other two players fight him off as rebels.\nFor 4 players, a game in which you and your ally will team up to fight your rival alliance to control the world!",

Several games should be played to find a winner.\n\nOne player is elected Banker. He starts the Pool by placing 6 counters into it. He then shuffles and deals 14 cards face down. All the other players now place a bet (counters, not real money) on any card they wish. No more than one can bet on any one card. When all bets are placed, the first card is drawn. The player who bet on it must follow the instructions.\n\nIf the Banker role changes hands, a new deal shall be started. But Note: Sometimes a player's call against the Bank cannot be met. The deficiency is made up as far as possible from the Reserve. Then the Bank is 'broken' and the Bank role is transferred to the player on the Banker's left. This player starts a new Bank by putting in the 6 counters that are required.\n\nCards are:\nOne In, Two In, etc. = Player puts counters into the Pool\nOne Out, Two Out, etc. = Player takes out counters from the Pool\nReserve = Every player puts 1 counter into the Bank Reserve. This Reserve is set aside in a special pool, for use on special occasions. It transfers when the Bank is transferred, and only withdraws when Bank Holiday is turned.\nOfficial Receiver = When turned, the Bank and Reserve (if any) transfers to the player who has backed the card, but that player pays over to the retiring Banker counters equal to the number then in the Pool (but not counting in the Reserve). The Banker taking over shall not scoop the Pool, which stays untouched and the game proceeds.\nDistribution = When revealed, every player, including the Banker, receives a counter from the Pool.\nContribution = Every player, including Banker, puts a counter into the Pool.\nScoop = The player backing this card scoops the entire Bank, which now transfers to him. The Reserve remains untouched. He starts a new Bank with 6 counters.\nStake = This gives an advantage to the last player to have put down a stake of 6 counters to start a Bank. He claims 6 counters from the player who backed this card. The current Banker usually will be the one who staked the 6 counters into the Pool, but if a new Banker takes over because of the Official Receiver card or the Transfer Bank card (neither of which do not require 6 counters being paid into the Pool, so the player who benefits by this card will be the previous Banker perhaps).\nTransfer Bank = The Bank transfers to the player who backed this card, but its capital cannot be increased or the Reserve interfered with.\nBank Holiday = The Bank's Scoop card. When revealed, the Bank scoops both Bank and Reserve, and starts a new Bank with a stake of 6 counters.",

Nein, bei Knock out wird auch richtig gegeneinander gewettet. Was der Eine gewinnt, verliert der Andere. Da\u00df man dabei gelegentlich auch mal gegen die eigenen Jungs wettet, versteht sich von selbst. Pokal oder Steak? Sieg oder Niederlage, hei\u00dft es immer wieder.Damit sich Ihre Boxer im Ring durchsetzen und Ihnen dicke Siegpr\u00e4mien bescheren, m\u00fcssen Sie sich Ihre Karten von Anfang an gut einteilen. Andernfalls geht Ihnen am Ende noch die Puste aus, und Ihre Boxer werden vorzeitig auf die Bretter geschickt. Achten Sie besonders auf die verdeckten linken Haken, sonst erleben Sie am Ende noch eine b\u00f6se \u00dcberraschung. Mit Geschick, Taktik, Bluff und dem n\u00f6tigen Quentchen Gl\u00fcck \u00fcberstehen Sie erfolgreich die Saison und streichen am Ende vielleicht sogar einen fetten Bonus ein.",

                    "description": "This is an old Parker Brothers sequence card game. The deck consists of three Block cards and five suits - A, B, C, D, and E. The suit cards run from 1 to 11 (there is no A4 or A9). The entire deck is dealt out to the players. The player to the left of the dealer starts by laying down any card from his hand. The player who holds the next higher card in the suit (regardless of where they sit at the table) must follow, laying the card down on the table (D4 followed by D5 for example). Then whoever holds the next higher card plays that, thus continuing in sequence (unless blocked) until the high card of the suit is reached.\n\nWhoever plays the high card (or blocks) gains the Lead, and starts a new sequence by playing any suit card from his hand, thus getting rid of two of his cards. If you have a Block card and you wish to \"block\" a sequence, you play the next card in the sequence paired with the Block card. You then Lead the next sequence, thus getting rid of three of your cards. As the hand continues, natural blocks occur due to players leading with cards in the middle of suits. The player who plays the A5 or the A10 card wins an immediate 5 or 10 points respectively.\n\nWhen a player plays his last card, the hand ends, and that player receives 1 point for every card left in the other player's hands. He also scores 5 or 10 points if the A5 or the A10 cards remain unplayed. A player still holding a Block card loses 5 points as a penalty. The first player to score 100 points wins.",

                    "description": "Update:\n\nFrom the GMT Talon Reprint page: \"Solitaire: - The Talon system plays extremely well solitaire for two reasons:\n\n1. There is no hidden information.\n\n2. There are no simultaneous decisions. Each decision happens sequentially.\n\nHowever, a dedicated Solitaire System is being released with Talon 1000. See the (GMT) Talon 1000 page for more information.\"\nBGG listing for Talon 1000.\n\nDesigner: Jim Krohn, Developer: Bob Seifert\n\nBackground:\n\nLong hampered by cost and beset by international problems, real space exploration did not seem possible for humanity. Amazing technological breakthroughs would change all of that in the year 2112. The invention of the Near Faster Than Light (NFTL) drive would make it possible for large ships to move easily in and out of a planet's gravity well, and to travel quickly within the confines of a solar system. Ten years later, the perfecting of Faster Than Light (FTL) drive would turn the galaxy into an open canvas. United by a common purpose, the newly formed Terran Confederation began to paint their picture.\n\nExpansion led to colonies, research stations, and even more technological discoveries, but it also led to the realization that they were not alone. Although no sentient alien species had been encountered, long range scanners had picked up the distinctive signatures of FTL drives. Sentient races must exist... and they must be space faring. Terran expansion stopped.\n\nNot knowing what to expect, a period of consolidation followed which emphasized defensive technologies and fleet building. First contact was made by the people of Earth with this unknown race in 2227. Over time, they would eventually call these other-worlders the Talon. It was a shortening of the alien sounds that made up their name but it was also oddly prophetic-the Talon Empire swooped in very much like a raptor upon the fledgling Terran Confederation.\n\nGame Scale:\n\nUnits: Individual capital ships and fighters\n\nTime: Individual fleet battles\n\nPlayers: 2 to 6\n\nMap: Each hex represents a region of space that normally holds only one ship\n\nSolitaire Suitability: there is no hidden information and no simultaneous action\n\nWelcome to the Talonverse.....\nTalon is a game of tactical space combat set in a growing universe with its own history and back story. This game introduces battles during the First Talon War between the Terran Confederation and the Talon Empire.\n\nThis is a Fleet Combat game. Battles with individual ships can be fought, but the game easily and quickly simulates combat with fleets of 3-10 ships. These are fleets of Capital Ships. This is NOT a game about fighter combat in space. Most ships in the game are large and you must balance your ships' power output between shields, weapons, sensors and maneuverability - you are not just doing an Immelman. Each faction has unique abilities and each ship has unique features. Proper strategy involves assessing the different abilities of your ships and the enemy's.\n\nThis is an Accessible game. The complexity of managing fleets of capital ships has been baked into the game system, leaving the player free to make interesting decisions. It is also a Fast Paced game. Small fleet scenarios can be played in one hour, larger ones in under two. This makes the game thematically rich and full of quick but meaningful choices.\n\nHow can the game do all this? All a ship's energy use is integrated into something called a Power Curve. All a player has to do is adjust the speed of the ship. A ship's speed determines how much Available Power it gets to charge weapons faster, reinforce shields, tighten turns... but there will never be enough of it. The game is fought on a Map - distances moved, firing arcs, shield arcs are distinct and easily resolved. The game uses Very Large, Laminated Counters. All of a ship's systems are displayed directly on the counter and lamination allows you to mark damage and other ship info with a dry erase marker. All of the important information is at your fingertips, at-a-glance, on the map. Being able to see the battle unfold on map allows the game system to handle a much larger number of ships without confusion and effort.\n\nGame Features\n\nTerran Fleet (10 different ship classes)\nTalon Fleet (9 different ship classes)\nShips with 4 Shield Arcs\nFighter Squadrons\nBases, Transports\nUnique Abilities for each faction\nAsteroids, Planets, Nebulae\nBlack Holes, Worm Holes\n6 Different Weapon Systems including Missiles that track on the board\nNFTL and FTL Drives\n12 Scenarios following the story of the First Talon War\nMission Variety: Escort missions, planetary invasions, base assaults...\nLifetime Score tracking\nEmpire War campaign game with dynamic, strategic-level decisions\nPoint System for Purchasing Ships and Design-Your-Own Scenarios\nA tie in with Space Empires 4x",

Fortunately, being a peaceful people you have chosen not to fight over what little there is. Instead, you set out in your seagoing Wa\u2019a (canoe) to fish and gather crops from the many nearby islands. The fertility goddess Haumea has blessed these islands, and they are rich with fruits, vegetables, and spices. It is a matter of pride to collect the finest harvest for the village. Can you win the race against time and the sea, and prove that you are the best gatherer of all?\n\nIn Tahiti the goal is to collect crops (coconuts, taro, bananas, spice) and fish from the surrounding islands to score points with bonuses for making full sets and acquiring the most of their family favorites which are hidden from the other players.\n\nThe game starts off with just your home island and its immediate neighboring islands. Players build up the archipelago of fertile islands with the guidance of Haumea for the first part of the game until all islands are in play. Players seed the islands each turn giving them some control over where crops replenish. Once the archipelago is formed, the late season is triggered when crops start becoming scarce, with players occasionally stopping an island from producing altogether. Although the late season may not be as good for crops, fishing becomes easier with bonuses given to the waters around some of the islands.\nDuring all this the players travel by Wa\u2019a from island to island using action points to collect the crops they want or can get to before the others take them. As the Wa\u2019a fills, it becomes slower limiting the number of actions they have. There are also treacherous reefs around the islands that require you go around them or risk losing some of the crops aboard your Wa\u2019a. At the end of the year, the one who most efficiently gathers food for their family wins.",

Stand by your button as the emcee announces each question. The first player to hit the button gets to answer. But listen carefully - is it a bluff? Should you challenge? It's up to you. You'll get points if you're right, lose points if you're wrong. The digital display automatically registers each player's points.\n\nCall My Bluff is a trivia game that involves a large console with a cassette tape player. Special cassettes indicate to the console how many points a player gets for answering the question correctly (as some of the questions are worth more points than others.)\n\nWhile the game was published by Charan Toys, the cassette technology was licensed from Words of Wonder, the company responsible for the hugely successful Teddy Ruxpin series of toys.",

You can strike out, foul out, tag a runner at first, hit a home run, field a foul ball and more.\"\n\nThe game box also functions as a score keeping device by marking the score with the provided paperboard bats into slots at the proper numbers. The game is mostly dictated by the spinner and the cards are primarily the game board and status markers for the spinner results. The one exception is the fielding cards which will give variable results for base running after hits are spun. There is little to no decision making in the game as it is totally run by the spinner and fielding cards.\n\nThe instructions are in English and French.",

It is a game of tactics, cunning and ambush.\n\nPlan your attack, secure your defence, strike when ready.\n\nChameleon is played on 6 colour game board and comes with 12 pegs, 2 'chameleon' die, a rules booklet and a strategy brochure. Each player (either black or white) plays with 6 pegs that are red, yellow, green, blue, orange and purple.\n\nThe aim of the game is to be the first player to move all six tokens from your 'starting grid' into your 'home base' whilst trying to stop (or zap!) your opponent from doing the same. If you're on your own colour you are a chameleon and can't be seen. If you're off your colour you'd better watch out!\"",

                    "description": "Taking on the roles of land-owners in a feudal society, players are charged with running their lands and accruing favor from the bishop by building his cathedral. Each turn, players use their resources to bid for that year's agenda, and some resources have more or less value in the bid depending on what type of agenda is available. Then players use their remaining resources to build their lands, sack others' lands, bribe others' knights away from defense, or help to build the bishop's cathedral. Finally, players harvest new resources for the next turn. After all the pieces of the cathedral have been built, the game is over with the victory going to the player with the most victory points. This game was originally released as Charlemagne by Think Games at Essen 1998, and later slightly shortened as Krieg und Frieden.\n\nRe-implements:\n\nCharlemagne",

Dice rolls determine movement. You can jump single enemies (except uphill) and flip them over to become yours. A piece landing on the summit becomes a Field Marshal, which cannot be jumped but may leap and convert entire rows of enemies. However, there can only be one Field Marshal, whose allegiance proves difficult to retain; it must vacate the sacred peak immediately, allowing others to reach it and wrest control. Things can get hectic, but patiently blocking upwardly mobile forces in order to keep the fickle Field Marshal loyal usually wins. Still, this is a feisty game that can literally be enjoyed at all levels.",

Out of these grow snakes, consisting of alternating neutral and coloured wooden segments.\nIn the beginning of the game, each player draws randomly one of five colours. On his turn, each player takes one neutral and one coloured segment of his choice and puts them on one of the three snakes.\nAim of the game is to have the highest score in the end - having the most elements of your colour in the \"best counting\" snake, depending on the basket and the snake`s head. This can pe put on the top of any snake by any player before his regular move, but before this, the others have the chance to make a guess about his colour. If they are right, he MUST discover his colour, thus giving the others an advantage, and is not allowed to move the head. If the guess is wrong, he may put the head on the top of a snake or move it on top of another one.\nThe game ends, when all players pass or if one of the snakes topples down - the score for the player causing this is zero.\nBest to be played in several rounds, adding the scores.",

The player whose stock of jewels has the highest value wins the game.\n\nEvery player has a set of 12 cards, each card showing a character the player can impersonate. Each of the characters has a special ability which can be used (the diamond dealer, for example, can buy diamonds twice, the pickpocket steals a coin from the richest player etc.). Although all of the players try to gather as many jewels as possible, these cannot be collected easily as they have to be purchased with coins first.\n\nThe game ends as soon as one of the player cannot play any character during his turn. After this the jewels which have been collected are counted. Players score one point for each diamond and five points for each ruby they gathered.\n\nFrom the English rules:\nIt is a time of intrigues over the marquis' domain. The Prosecutor, the extortioner and the countess covet the invaluable jewels of each other. To buy jewels at the best price, players will have to continuously impersonate new characters. Choose wisely between the 11 roles available and fortune will change hands relentlessly. But do not forget that money is only a mean to achieve your goal. At the end, the title of \u201cMarquis\u201c will go the one with the fullest jewel case. So be cautious!\n\nForget \u201cNoblesse oblige\u201c, now play catch as catch can.

                    "description": "Extracted from consimworld.com:\n\nIBEROS is an operational simulation of low to medium complexity of warfare in the Ancient Peninsula. It is packaged in a slipcase box that includes one 60 x 52 cm map, 240 full-color die cut counters, one standard and scenario rules booklet, one historical commentary booklet, and two player aid cards. Game turns are one year each: after collecting silver and/or receiving it from Rome, you can pay your troops, recruit tribal levies, and perform other administrative functions. After that comes the Operations Phase. During it, each force (one or more Field Armies, Tribal Levies, etc) can perform certain operations, using Operation Points (OP). These actions include combat, diplomacy (you can try to control any area through diplomacy), besiege cities, pillage, recruit mercenaries, or build colonies. At the end of the Operations Phase, forces retire to winter quarters.\n\nThe most outstanding features of the game are the Prestige Point Level and the differences between Regular and Irregular warfare. The Prestige Level (PP) simulates the prestige of the civilized armies (Punic, Romans, Sertorians) among the Iberian tribes, and the tendency of the latter to switch to the side that seems to be winning... Certain results of the CRTs add or decrease the PP level of each side. Then, if your PP level is above 2, you have positive die roll modifiers on the Diplomacy Table. And vice versa if your PP level is 0 or lower. Leaders play a key role since their modifiers are applied to retreat before combat, diplomacy, all kinds of combat, operations, interception, etc. Leaders are rated for Military and Diplomatic skills (The highest is Sertorius, with +3 +3). Roman leaders (Praetors, one each for Hispania Citerior and Hispania Ulterior) are changed randomly each year when they're elected by the Senate of Rome. If you have quality leaders, your chances of avoid/provoke combat are higher, and vice versa.\n\nThe irregular, \"hit and run\" tactics of the inhabitants of the peninsula characterized the Roman conquest and were the cause why the Romans took 200 years to completely control all of Hispania. All combat units have Regular and Irregular Combat factors. The attacker can always choose which CRT he is going to use. The idea here was to simulate the asymmetrical war fought out between the Roman/Punic invaders and the native peoples. If you can impose your style of fighting, (the other can not avoid combat) then you have the edge over the enemy.\n\nThe game is played in scenarios. There are 9, from the Punic reconquest of Iberia (237-221 BCE) to the Cantabria campaigns of Caesar Augustus (24-19 BCE). There are a set of common rules for all the scenarios, plus specific rules for each scenario. There are fast playing scenarios (such as the Roman Civil War, or the Cantabrian wars) that can be played in two-three hours, and other that take 6-10 hour of play (up to 17 turns, such as Cato's campaign of 195 BCE, or the II Lusitanian War).\n\nEach scenario has its own Random Events Table. Some of the Random Events included are: plague, Excellent/Bad Crops, Tribal Rebellions galore, bribing enemy mercenaries, Numidian rebellion (for the II Punic War scenario), Alliance with Mithridates (Sertorius War scenario), and more.\n\nOptional rules include assassination of enemy leaders (you must spend Operations Points and Treasury Points for that), Rivalry between Iberian tribes (The Romans took advantage of this to apply the \"divide and conquer\" routine), Mountain redoubts (Mons Vidius, Mons Medulius...), or troop upgrade.",

However, many players elect to use later rules editions and make the money count as the measure of the game. Starting with \u00a3700, each player can buy horses and/or businesses in two steps, first by lot and then by auction. Then the players make one lap around the Training Track of the gameboard with each of their horses. Here the players collect advantage and disadvantage cards to be used in the race. Also on the Training Track, the players gain or lose money that can be bet on the race. Once the players have circumnavigated the Training Track, the gameboard is flipped to reveal the Race Track.\n\nThe players may enter only 3 horses into the race. The players may bet on any horse to win. After the betting is over the race begins. The players roll one die and move their horses in turn, utilizing the cards earned during the first half of the game whenever it is felt to be advantageous. The players who bet on the winning horse divide the money bet on the race minus ten percent (that goes to the Bookmaker).",

Players take actions such as contracting men, acquiring ships and buildings, sailing the seas, establishing colonies in discovered lands, trading goods on the market, and getting privileges.\n\nEach player starts with only two ships and three workers and tries to expand his wealth.\n\nThere are several undiscovered lands that allow players, once discovered, to found some colonies there. Colonies exist in different places where sugar, gold and spices are available and can be sold to the market to make some money. Money is used to build ships, erect buildings such as factories, shipyards and churches, and to get workers. Workers are necessary to found colonies or to acquire buildings and privileges, which exist in five categories and therefore encourage players to follow different strategies competing with each other.\n\nAt the end of the game the player who is most successful in combining his privileges with his achievements (colonies, factories, discoveries, shipyards, and churches) is the winner.",

They thereby won expertise in navigation and shipbuilding, heralding the Age of Exploration and enabling Portugal to later to find a sea trade route to India and China. In the height of its power Portugal controlled the sea trade from Brazil to Japan and attained overwhelming wealth with the trade monopoly on spices.\nThe players represent wealthy trade dynasties that help to build up the Portuguese colonial empire. Tracing the routes of famous explorers they advance all the way to Nagasaki--but sailing into unknown waters is a dangerous venture. Founding colonies and building factories helps them to build up an economic base. But the prices for sugar, gold and spices fluctuate all the time, and only the trade dynasty that adapts to the market will be able to finance its lofty plans. Competing for new discoveries, colonies, shipyards, and churches it is very important to observe the actions of the other players.\nNavigator for 2 to 5 players is a challenging strategy game with a little luck, because no-one knows exactly what to expect when discovering new sea regions. Player's turns follow simple rules and are executed on a rondel, which leads to a fluent play experience.",

Sometimes they need to banter and fight for prices. And sometimes they have to swallow their tears and abandon all they have built. If you can overcome these hurdles, earn the trust of people and build up a fortune, then you will be a true master merchant.\n\nMaster Merchant is a \"hand-building\" card game along the lines of the \"deck-building\" genre started by Dominion, except that players have no deck \u2013 only a hand of cards and a discard pile.\n\nPlayers start with a hand of two cards: \"Steal one gold from all players with four or more gold\" and \"Buy a card from the town\". On each turn a player can play up to two cards from his hand, either face up to gain a card's effect or face down to gain one gold.\n\nThe \"town\" consists of ten different types of cards, which cost 1-4 gold. All cards played and purchased go into a player's personal discard pile, which is open information to all players. If a player starts his turn with no cards, he picks up his entire discard pile. The first player to get eight gold or eight different cards wins the game.\n\nThis game's setting is same as Mai-Star, which is from the same designer, artist and publisher.",

Race order and tadpole tokens mean that you will still have a chance of winning even going into the last race. Points are scored depending on race position but also for collecting tadpoles. Remember, only frogs that have not had their legs eaten can win the game !",

Well, most players fall into that category, but one takes the role of marshal and tries to keep the other players honest.\n\nDuring set-up, a money tile is placed in each bank, a poker tile in each city without a bank, and a stagecoach in a randomly-determined city. Each outlaw starts in a city, and the marshal has both a marshal token and a number of sheriffs equal to the number of outlaws, with these tokens starting wherever the marshal places them.\n\nThe game lasts five turns, with five movement cards played by each player in each turn. Each player has an individual hand of movement cards, including a \"Saloon\" card that allows a player to stay in the same location. The marshal moves the stagecoach, moves each sheriff (or leaves them in place), then the marshal and the outlaws alternate laying five face-down movement cards. If an outlaw wants to take an action in a city \u2013 robbing a bank, a card game, or a stagecoach \u2013 he must show his location card to the marshal, then place his wooden disk on that location.\n\nOnce all five movement cards have been placed, the players all reveal the first card and move their tokens. If the marshal is in the same city as an outlaw, that player is jailed and loses all movement and action for the remainder of the turn; that player also loses that movement card for the remainder of the game. If an outlaw is in a location with his action disk, he can take that action \u2013 as long as more outlaws are present than sheriffs. (Players pool their money, so there's no dispute over which outlaw robbed a place.)\n\nOnce players finish their five movements, they pick up all their movement cards, the marshal replaces stolen tiles (and adds a second stagecoach in the second turn), and a new turn begins. If at the end of the game, the desperados have collected $4,000 or more per outlaw, then they win the game; otherwise the marshal wins as the outlaws \u2013 despite stealing huge amounts of funds \u2013 have not secured enough funds to guarantee their livelihood in their golden years.",

The bottom row will consist of 7 cards, with the peak consisting of a single card.\n\nThe player works to remove all cards from the pyramid by making sets of two cards that add up to 13. Aces are worth 1, Jacks are 11, Queens 12, and Kings 13 (and can be removed individually).\n\nThe remaining cards make up the Stock, or draw pile, and can be used to make sets.\n\nThe game is over if no more sets can be removed from the board, and a score is given by the value of cards left in the pyramid.

                    "description": "Enigma is a micro board game for two, which is played on a small battle map and uses playing cards to code and decode messages. Each player, using his own deck of playing cards, will code a single word using one of two ciphers available to them. Once both players have coded a message they will then exchange the cards and start to decode their opponent\u2019s password. The first to crack the code will have several strategical maneuvers available at his disposal while the person who fails to crack the code will be given only one move. The key objective is to control as much of your enemy\u2019s territory as possible before the game ends after ten rounds of code cracking.\n\nSetup\nPlace the map between you and your opponent. In addition to the map, each player has a card shield to place upright in front of them. This not only keeps your code making secret but also is used to show the two ciphers available for coding. To begin, each player should have 5 pennies placed on opposite sides of the map (on the edge closest to you). At this point, you should be ready to start creating codes.\n\nPlay\nEach turn begins with both players creating a code using one of two ciphers available. The secret code must be at least three letters long and not have the same letter repeating more than twice. Once both players have cards selected to spell out their coded word, exchange cards. At this point, the person who can correctly decode their opponent\u2019s message first will be awarded the next move on the map.The player who successfully decoded the message will have a list of maneuvers they can choose from while the other opponent (who failed) is only allowed one single move.\n\nGame end\nThe game ends when all ten rounds of code cracking have been completed and all final moves have been made. The game play length can be adjusted by increasing or decreasing the amount of rounds to be played.",

Players use a mix of memory and deduction to rediscover their identities. The first player to do so is the winner!\n\n\nGameplay Overview\n\nPlayers each hold 4-5 cards in their hand. However, 1 of these cards is only visible to their opponents. The aim of the game is to successfully guess your hidden card (1 of 16 characters).\n\nOn their turn, players may ask any 1 opponent how many cards they hold of a particular type (hair colour or face type). Players must answer truthfully and out loud for everyone to hear. As information comes out, players can begin to deduce which character they are (or are not).\n\nOnce a player thinks they know which character they are, they can make a guess. If they are correct, they win! If they are wrong, they are knocked out of the game.",

The object is to get a piece to the row farthest away from you. On a turn a piece can move any distance diagonally as long as it does not pass over any piece or land on an opponent's piece.\n\nThe fourth and seventh rows of the board are \"wall\" rows, and pieces which reach the opposing wall cannot move forward. The only way to get a piece across the wall (necessary to win) is via explosion. Each space has a maximum capacity (depending on which column it is in), and when you get that many of your pieces in a space it explodes, sending the pieces to orthogonally adjacent spaces. Opposing pieces can be captured this way, and chain reactions can occur.\n\nThe game was published in the January 1984 issue of GAMES.",

Your goal in Kharnage is to take control of something strategically essential, astoundingly beautiful, and envy of all other nations: a hill. Yes, just a hill. Admittedly, it is a nice hill. It may have a very commanding view of the surroundings, or it may not. You won't know until you get up there! To do so, you're going to have to drive off the armies of the other players by simply causing as much mayhem and bloodshed as possible.\n\nEach turn, you choose one battle card. The player with the lowest initiative value begins and:\n\n\nDeploys new units and applies skills if needed, or\nAttacks (shoot or assault) one opponent with all points, or two opponents by dividing their points.\n\n\nThe next player then begins their turn, doing the same. After all players have taken their turn, the player who destroyed the largest number of units wins 5 domination points, the second 3 domination points, and the third 1 domination point. The last one has only their eyes for crying.\n\nEach time a player totally destroys an opponent army, they must yell \"KHARNAGE!\", loud and clear, and stomp the table. They then take a Kharnage token worth 1 domination point. The other players must cheer them on by yelling \"YEAH!\"; if not, they lose a Kharnage token if they have one.\n\nAfter four rounds, the warchief with the most domination points wins!",

                    "description": "In this game by Editrice Giochi, players use cards to build up armies with production points. The actual gameplay is similar to Risk, with players taking it in turns to produce units, move them and then perform combat by rolling dice. The twist, and the major way in which it differs from Risk, is in the different unit types.\nLand, Sea and Air forces may all be built, with differing movement and combat abilities. For example, air units move further and determine first firer in combat, but cost more to build.\nIn short, I would describe this game as \"Risk with attitude\", and is definitely preferable to normal risk. It is less luck-based, due to special dice used for combat.",

It's long past bedtime, but they sneaked out of the wizards' school to visit the secret midnight market and see the flying brooms and talking cats they heard the grown-ups talk about. Unfortunately they don't get far for while crossing the forest near the wizards' school, Willy the Warden Ghost takes up their trail. Now they have to double back quickly or they are facing detention. But the forest is too dark to find the way back without help. Luckily they have an idea: The Lumies, magical glowing creatures that live in the forest, can light their way back to the school. The wizard students need to stick together to find the Lumies and make it back to the school before Willy catches one of them.\n\nWhile escaping the Warden Ghost in Wizardry to the power of three, players need to work together, memorize the tree tiles, and use their magic potions and dice enchantments at the right time to make it back without being caught and win as a team.",

Players take on the roles of space traders who move their ships through interconnected systems discovering new alien worlds to trade with. As players start to make money delivering commodities in a unique supply-and-demand system, their earnings can be used to purchase better ships and equipment (shields, lasers, engines, etc...) and construct their own spaceports (which speed up trading) and factories (which create better commodities). Variations included in the rulebook allow for interplayer combat. The player who first acquires enough total value ($1000, $2000, $3000, $4000) in cash and port/factory deeds takes the day.\n\nFor the 2012 edition of Merchant of Venus from Fantasy Flight Games, the company promises that this revision \"remains true to its magnificently campy core while updating the map and game components and expanding game play in surprising ways that will cause even the most hardcore fan to celebrate.\" That said, the player count has been lowered from six (in the Avalon Hill edition) to four, with the four races in the game being Human, Whynom, Qossuth, and Eeepeeep.",

During a turn, you roll a die, optionally move any of your hedgehogs one row left or right, then move any hedgehog (not necessarily yours!) in the row your rolled forward one space. But watch out for black spaces; hedgehogs caught there can't continue moving until they're in last place. The first player to get three of their four hedgehogs to the end of the board wins. Some later versions of this game come with dozens of different variants to keep the game interesting.\n\nTante Tarantel (Aunt Tarantula) scoots round her web, gobbling up your insects as they try to escape. The web is a spiral, you roll the die and move Auntie, then take turns to move one of your bugs towards the exit space. Initially, Auntie is in a good mood, if she runs into a bug or bugs, they go back to her larder. But as soon as someone escapes, she loses her temper and kills anything she catches! The game has a scoring track, and each time a bug is caught or escapes, a marker moves up, also adding a number to the die roll. So Auntie runs around the web faster and faster. Players can share some spaces, but most of the time, bump each other back and forth. Naturally, nasty bugs push others into Aunty's path to certain death!\n\nSlightly confusing when you start, this is actually a really simple game, easily as good as any D&F game. The original set had wooden pawns for the bugs, but D&F issued a series of neat rubber bugs, which do add to the games' style.",

Once a duck has an aim token over it any player can play a 'Fire' card to shoot them and thus eliminate the duck from the gallery. When a player has all of their ducks eliminated they are out of the game.\n\nThe player's also have access to many special cards that allow the line to be manipulated. Results can be the movement of ducks, however Aim Tokens do not move and in this way a player an protect their ducks and threaten those of the opposition.\n\nThe game play is similar to Guillotine in the way that the line can be manipulated and the special effect cards on offer.",

During this period, known as the Dark Ages, many people invaded the continent, each hoping to colonize it or conquer a realm there, replacing other people established before them. But the new conquerors would never maintain their new powers for long, as they were also invaded by other invaders.\n\nThe game ends by the time those great migrations ended. In this epic game, each player controls many different peoples. Each of them is a realm at the best possible location, in view of historical objectives assigned by the rules. Some will prevail and found strong kingdoms and prosperous empires ... others will vanish in the void of history.\n\nInvasion marks the return to board game of Philip Thibaut, the creator of the critically acclaimed Europa Universalis, that he also adapted for PC, and of The Great War '14 -'18. Philippe is also the creator and designer of American Civil War games, Pax Romana, Rise of Prussia or Birth of America.",

                    "description": "Story\n\nThe King of Blackthorn rose to power on the strength of his sword, gaining the devotion of the people as he forged a nation and purged the ravages of war. Once a much needed beacon of strength for a foundling kingdom, he has now grown old and is no longer a vital part of a now robust and powerful country. Others have risen to prominence and power within his council. Adept in their machinations and plots, the councilors have their own self serving ambitions. In a shadowy battle of subterfuge they ruthlessly vie against one another for true control of Blackthorn. In this dance of treachery, each must seize as much power as able without drawing suspicion for whispers of treason echo through the halls of the King of Blackthorn. Whispers from fellow councilors designed to implicate and see the competition shortened by a head. The King will call for the axe for any he deems a traitor and there is always the risk that he is not as ignorant of the schemes as he seems.\n\nAs a member of the Council of Blackthorn, you must build influence with the kingdom\u2019s factions to expand your political influence. Rumors, bribes, spies and poison are the tools of your trade. Council of Blackthorn is about secretly gaining power while convincing your rival council members that you are not a threat. Deflect all eyes onto your most powerful enemy and take the keys to the kingdom as well as a great seat at his or her execution. Attract too much attention to yourself and the King\u2019s axe will find you!\n\nGain influence, accuse your rivals, keep your head!\n\nGame Overview and Objective\n\nCouncil of Blackthorn is a board game for 2 to 6 players. Each player assumes the role of a member of the Council of Blackthorn. There are several different council member characters to play. Each player must build influence with the kingdom\u2019s political factions by playing ally and building cards. Custom dice change the game conditions for each round. As players gain influence and power, they also gain hidden treason points. The players that appear to have the most power will typically gain more treason points. The player with the most treason points at the end of the game is beheaded for treason and is removed from the game. The remaining player with the most total influence points, wins the game.",

                    "description": "Carcassonne is a tile-placement game in which the players draw and place a tile with a piece of southern French landscape on it. The tile might feature a city, a road, a cloister, grassland or some combination thereof, and it must be placed adjacent to tiles that have already been played, in such a way that cities are connected to cities, roads to roads, etcetera. Having placed a tile, the player can then decide to place one of his meeples on one of the areas on it: on the city as a knight, on the road as a robber, on a cloister as a monk, or on the grass as a farmer. When that area is complete, that meeple scores points for its owner.\n\nDuring a game of Carcassonne, players are faced with decisions like: \"Is it really worth putting my last meeple there?\" or \"Should I use this tile to expand my city, or should I place it near my opponent instead, giving him a hard time to complete his project and score points?\" Since players place only one tile and have the option to place one meeple on it, turns proceed quickly even if it is a game full of options and possibilities.\n\nThis special edition is sold exclusively by the German trade company M\u00fcller. It comes in a similar metal box as previous special editions and contains the Carcassonne base game along with the expansion set Carcassonne: Expansion 6 \u2013 Count, King & Robber and Die Belagerer which is a new six-tile version of Carcassonne: Die Katharer (with new graphics but similar to the Rio Grande Games (2008) release).",

The game is rather simplem, although an experienced player will defeat a newcomer, as it must be taken into account what shapes both you and your opponent have remaining to play well.\n\nFor the solitaire game, the game instructions come with 19 puzzles to try and recreate. Some of them are suprisingly challenging to do. You can also create your own challenges by placing the king (and optionally one or two blocks) on the board and trying to fill in the remaining space with the remaining shapes.\n\nSubmit a better description and contact Admin Skelebone for a GeekGold reward.",

Each of these additional cells is called a Fortress and belongs to a player.\n\nEach player has three kinds of pieces in their own color: one General, four Officers, and seven Soldiers. To begin the game, the General pieces are placed in the middle triangle of the first row adjoining that player's Fortress. Filling out that row are the four Officers. The next row inward has seven triangles and each are occupied by Soldiers. These two rows are known as each player's Zone.\n\nThe object of the game is to move a General into an opponent's Fortress. A cell may be occupied by only one piece at a time; players capture each other's pieces by landing on the same cell and removing the opponent's piece from the board. Capture is not compulsory, and continuing moves after a capture is not permitted. Movement of the pieces is through the sides of the triangular cells, not the points.\n\nA Soldier moves to one adjacent cell in any direction except backwards towards his home Fortress. An Officer moves across two adjacent cells, unless there is a piece he wishes to capture in one adjacent cell. After capturing, he must remain in that cell until the next turn. While in their own Zone, Officers may not move back towards their own Fortress. Once out of their Zone, Officers may move in any direction. Generals move across one or two adjacent cells in any combination of directions, so long as they do not return to the same cell on the same turn.\n\nThe first player to move his General into an opponent's Fortress wins the game. Since it is possible for any piece to capture any other piece, it is possible that all three Generals could be captured and no player would win.",

Jeder versucht nun, als erster unter den 49 ausgelegten Zahlen drei nebeneinander liegende zu finden, mit denen man die aufgedeckte Zahl bilden kann. Zwei der drei Zahlen werden dabei miteinander malgenommen, die dritte davon abgezogen oder dazugez\u00e4hlt. Die drei Zahlen d\u00fcrfen waagerecht, senkrecht oder diagonal nebeneinander liegen, aber nicht im Winkel. Beispiel: 32= 5 x 7 -3 oder 32= 5 x 6 +2 Wer als erster eine Kombination findet, erh\u00e4lt die runde Zahlenkarte. Es wird so lange gespielt, bis alle runden Zahlenkarten aufgebraucht sind.

                    "description": "Eight-Minute Empire, by Ryan Laukat, is a quick game that implements the Civilization/Exploration theme using card-driven area control (by placing armies and cities in a small map) and set collection (by getting resources from the board and the cards). Players spread through the map in order to collect points at the end of the game by having majorities in regions and continents. All actions (such as land or sea movement, army production, or the founding of cities) are driven by cards that are face-up (six at a time) and available by increasing prices. Cards also contain resources, which also give points when the game ends if properly collected.\n\nIts first version was available as print-and-play, and a regular (Kickstarter funded) version was published in 2013. An expansion featuring a European map is available as an expansion (Eight-Minute Empire: Europe Expansion Board), and a stand-alone sequel has also been published (Eight-Minute Empire: Legends).\n\nFrom the publisher:\nBuild an empire and conquer the land in around eight minutes!\n\nIn Eight-Minute Empire, 2-5 players take turns selecting a card from six displayed. The card gives a good, and also has an action that the player takes immediately. Actions help players take over the map, but sets of goods are worth points at the end of the game, so players have to balance the two aspects.\n\nEight-Minute Empire is the super-quick area control game with tough decisions. It's easy to learn and perfect for when you only have a few minutes.",

The players play their card simultaneously and blind. The highest card gets the trick; if there is a two-way tie, the remaining player gets the trick. If there is a three-way tie, the winner of the next trick gets this trick as well. The special cards have other ways to win (or loose) a trick.\n\nWhen one of the players has run out of cards, each player counts his points. Some cards show chickens, and are worth points; others show animal droppings, and lower your point total.\n\nThe player who has gained the most points after three rounds wins the game.",

Players take on either the role of the United States, struggling to protect itself from foreign threat, or the role of one or more of the invading armies, fighting battle after battle to acquire important territories.\n\nIf the invading forces claim enough U.S. cities, America's defense is broken and the nation falls. But if the United States can protect its cities for long enough, the invading forces fail to uproot America and their incursion is ended.\n\nFortress America is played over several rounds in which each player musters his forces, moves into enemy-controlled territories, and engages in fierce firefights. But depending on whether you're the U.S. player or one of the Invaders, your play experience and general strategy will be entirely different. The U.S. must efficiently wield its colossal lasers, the ultimate weapons of mass destruction, in its own defense. What's more, as U.S. hovertanks, helicopters, bombers, and infantry are destroyed and removed from the map, a steady supply of American guerilla fighters spring up to defend their homeland. The U.S. player is surrounded and alone, and must do his best to fend off advances on three fronts in a series of tense battles.\n\nThe Invaders, on the other hand, must remain constantly aggressive. Their objective is to collectively capture 18 of 30 major U.S. cities, and to do so, they must apply early pressure before the U.S. has a chance to react, and keep the pressure constant. To complicate the Invaders' mission, their armies do not receive additional reinforcements, so they must make optimal use of the forces at their disposal. Through a series of nail-biting battles that use a unique dice-based combat system, each player will maneuver his dwindling armies to secure his objective. But can America be stopped, or will a failed invasion only compel them to tighten their military grip on the world.\n\nChanged in this edition:\n\n\nCustom combat dice, debatable if better than normal dice.\nA ten-turn timer gives the U.S. player an additional path to victory: outlasting the invasion.\nA \"Captured City\" track lets all players see, at a quick glance, how close they are to victory or defeat.\nA few city locations have been removed, and others added, to create a different (possibly more balanced) play experience.\nA deck of variant cards for the Invader players has been added to use as a rules option (equal to 1-2 balance levels).\n\n\nReimplements:\n\nFortress America (1986)",

The time has come for you and your siblings to demonstrate your intelligence, compassion, bravery, and strength as leaders. Out perform your siblings to demonstrate your ingenuity and strength. Choose strategies that will bring prosperity to the land and glory to your court. Defend the realm from threats and famine. Only the player with the most majestic court will be named heir.\n\nThere are many paths to choose from, but only one will become the next monarch. Who will reign?\n\nMonarch is a light strategy game for 2-4 players that lasts 45 minutes. The primary mechanic is set collection; each of the sisters aims to assemble a court of Court Cards in order to prove her worth: wise advisors, exotic animals, and symbolic regalia. Each of these Court Cards provides crowns, and the sister whose court contains the most crowns at the end of the game becomes the Queen.\n\nThere are tricks to assembling a majestic court. Some cards don't work together well: the Astronomer is worth nothing if in a court with the Fireworks because he will be unable to see anything! Other cards work very well together: the Beastkeeper is worth more crowns for each animal she shares a court with.",

They fight over provinces in quarterly turns. Combat can be fought tactically, using a separate display reminiscent of the way of resolving combat in Eagle games, with units assigned to various sections of the battlefield. Units which survive tactical combat can lay siege to cities.\n\nThe game can last varying numbers of turns, depending on the course of the war. There are several conditions, including the death of leaders and conquest of overwhelming numbers of provinces, that can end the game early. Otherwise the game ends in the summer of 323 (when Alexander actually died) or in an optional scenario, keep going up until 318 if Alexander survives that long.",

Four primary elements \u2014 Water, Earth, Fire and Air \u2014 start the foundation of a substance, and four secondary elements \u2014 Oil, Wood, Metal and Power \u2014 bring the substance to life.\n\nSubstances require 3-5 elements before they are complete. The harder to complete, the more points you earn. Complete a substance naturally (without the use of the ninth wild-card element, Meta) and earn bonus gems that can be used to complete other substances. Earn the most points, and you win!\n\nWhat actions you take each turn depend on your dice roll. Roll doubles and earn a bonus effect! The dice add an element of luck while managing your cards and gems adds an element of strategy.",

Odd cards have subtraction and division questions; answering them correctly moves the player's token backwards. When a token lands on certain spaces with instructions, the player must carry out what was printed as well (lose a turn, move the token to another space, etc).\n\nThe game ends when a player's token reaches Pluto, making him or her the winner.",

Angola is a multi-player game in which players control the various Soviet- and US-backed factions that vied for control of Angola from 1975 to 1976. Originally released in limited quantities by Ragnar Brothers of the UK, Angola quickly became a rare and highly sought after game of almost cult status. Why? Angola features a number of innovative game systems that keep players guessing, create plenty of tension, and reward the right balance of boldness and caution. MMP is now updating this classic with the fabulous graphics of the IGS line of games and bringing it to a wider audiences.\nThe map is divided into areas, and units represent military formations and also special weapons, such as artillery, rockets, tanks, and airplanes. A unique command and activation system has players committing in secret to the order in which they will activate a limited number of their units for the turn. The players then take turns activating their units in the determined order. The result is like a tense game of poker, with players trying to analyze the map and out guess their enemies.\nThe game is finely balanced, and all players frequently feel as if they are simultaneously on the verge of victory or defeat thanks to an ingenious victory point system that rewards good play for both sides and allows players to absorb reversals and strike back with the right countermove.",

Simultaneously, they sort them according to one or more public criteria (simplest example: higher number on top). To achieve this, a player may only use one hand, and may only hold one card in hand at any time. He may use any number of temporary stacks on the table, but the cards on table must be kept face-down all the time.\n\nThe first players who manage to accurately order their stack gain a chip. This takes them closer to victory, since the goal is to collect six chips. But for each chip you already have, you receive one more card to sort, so players behind have a good chance to catch up.",

Dripping with strategy, this fantasy-based RPG puts you in the skin of a new race and takes you on an adventure to the northern territories to root out and defeat growing enemy forces and of course the infamous \"baddie\" responsible.\n\nTeam up or go it alone in a 1-4 player Coop or Solo play campaign. With over 100+ unique skill dice and 4-7 classes to choose from, every battle is its own mini challenge to figure out. Your adventure will consist of 8-12 battles before you reach your final destination and face off against one of a number of possible kingpins in order to win. Along the way, you will be faced with storyline decisions that will quickly have you weighing risk/reward, odds, and logic - with dice woven into every aspect! Your party will also be faced with other decisions: when to rest, when to explore, or even which fights to pursue! The Encounter cards offer fun plot twists and some comic relief, all while setting the stage for your next battle.",

                    "description": "Cloudspire is 1-4 player strategy game heavily influenced by both tower defense and MOBA (Multiplayer Online Battle Arena) games. Solo and Cooperative play are driven by a scenario book that chronicles the story of the game from the perspective of each individual faction. Players control one of four unique factions in a battle to destroy and steal source energy from their opponents. Send and defend against armies and minions, build towers to protect your base, and explore with your heroes in search of resources and powerful Relics to turn the tide of battle.\n\nTaking place in the floating realm of Ankar, Cloudspire tells the story of a war to acquire a powerful and rare energy known only as \"the source.\" Every race has their own unique units and heroes as well as the ability to bid and draft mercenaries for hire.\n\nArmies are placed either individually or in stacks to conceal powerful units until the last possible moments. Heroes, in the meantime are controlled individually and may join the tide of battle or choose to explore points of interest in search of numerous resources. Meanwhile, the event deck regularly changes the terms of the fight, making every wave exciting and unpredictable.\n\nAs armies and minions approach opposing bases, they'll need to contend with Spires - powerful defense towers that can be built around the board. Fight for control of build sites and acquire new spire schematics to build an impenetrable defense and hold off the enemy. Upgrade your home base to unlock new strategies and abilities. Level up your heroes and lead your armies into battle with advanced and upgraded skills!",

Experience the ups and downs by collecting property color\u2019s sets to build houses, and hopefully upgrading to a hotel. But don\u2019t play just for certain colors, or else your opponent may change their strategy. The more properties each player owns, the more rent can be charged, but trading is where the game can help you, or hurt you. So, be wise! Chance cards could be worth money, like $10 for winning second place in a beauty pageant or sending you to \u201cGo\u201d for an extra $200; but you might just get the one that says, \u201cGo To Jail\u201d.

The emergency procedure states that there is a critical system failure and the space ship can't continue its cruise. The goal of the crew is to find what is causing this failure and fix the situation to safely return back to Earth. The main problem is that one crew member is dead. Somebody crashed his hibernation chamber and pulled his body out. In addition, if you listen closely, some additional noises and sounds can be heard. New ones, strange ones, ones that were never heard before\u2026\n\nNemesis is a cooperation game combined with bluffing, backstabbing, and other elements of a science-fiction survival horror adventure.",

If kept, the next card goes to the communal pile; if placed in the communal pile, the next card goes in your personal collection.\n\nAt the start of your turn, you can decide to use a container. If so, you assemble cards from personal and communal spaces, group them, then turn them all over. You have then \"collected\" those and can't use the container again.\n\nAt the end of the game, collectors determine the best collection as a combination of value from their collection, matching herbs, and herb sets.",

Why don't we start farming olives, like our neighbours?\".\n\nThe cart-driver nods: \"Ever since them city folks started worshipping San Giorgio I have to travel further and further to new building sites. I'm on my way now to the new inn they built. I'll change horses there and deliver this load\" he gestures towards the pile of wood in the cart with his head \"to the sea beyond. Gonna start some fisheries there. It is said we'll conquer those olive-farmers before long. But their land is even more polluted than ours.\"\n\nThe farmer nods his head in reply. As the cart starts moving again, he returns to the field to harvest the last bushels of grain, growing between the stumps of what used to be a lush forest - three turns ago.\n\nAntiquity is a strategy game for 2-4 players. It is set in an environment loosely modeled on Italy in the late Middle Ages. Players choose their own victory condition: they can focus on population growth, trade, conquest, or city building by choosing their patron saint. Each strategy requires a completely different style of play. Or you can choose to adore Santa Maria, the most powerful saint of all - but you'll be expected to build a civilization twice as impressive as any other player. While your economy is constantly improving, with more and more advanced cities bringing new options each turn, the land around your cities is slowly being depleted, forcing you to travel further and further to gather your raw materials - until finally, there is no more land left to farm. Let's hope one of you has won the game before that time!",

                    "description": "Haithabu is named after an important trading settlement located at the southern end of the Jutland Peninsula (on what's today the border of Denmark and Germany) that the Vikings used from the 8th to the 11th centuries. Its location on the Baltic and North Seas and on the trade routes between Scandinavia and the Frankish Empire led to goods from around the known world \u2014 such as the Baltics, Baghdad, and Constantinople \u2014 being traded here.\n\nThe subject of constant wars and changes of power, as well as the progressive Christianization of those in the north, Haithabu \u2014 known as \"Hedeby\" in English \u2014 had a rich history that ended in 1050 when the Norwegian king sacked and burned the town in a conflict with Denmark.\n\nAs Vikings, players trade with all the known world while also living through the changes and dark days at the end of the Early Middle Ages. In the game, players take turns performing individual actions on an action rondel, and what's most critical in the game is the timing of the actions because in each round each color of action can be selected only once. Players must react to market price changes and event dice that can cause complications.",

Jahrhundert, mit seinen Pfahlbauten und Br\u00fccken ist wieder Schauplatz eines allj\u00e4hrlichen Wettstreits der D\u00f6rfer. Welche Mannschaft \u00fcberwindet als schnellste den Weg zum gegen\u00fcberliegenden Dorf? Doch die Br\u00fccken haben ihre T\u00fccken: je geschickter man sie \u00fcberwindet, umso schneller kommt man voran. Doch schnell voran hei\u00dft manchmal auch \"am Ziel vorbei\". Wer hier das beste Mittelma\u00df findet, wird am Ende Sieger im \"Br\u00fcckenlauf von Haithabu\". Spielverlauf: die vier D\u00f6rfer von Haithabu sind mit einem System von 20 Br\u00fccken miteinander verbunden. Br\u00fcckensteine zeigen an, welche Br\u00fccken intakt und passierbar sind. Ziehen Spielfiguren \u00fcber Br\u00fccken, erobern sie die Br\u00fcckensteine und die Br\u00fccken sind geschlossen, aber nicht begehbar (Falle). Je mehr Br\u00fcckensteine ein Spieler gewinnt, umso schneller kommen seine Figuren voran. Doch jeder steht bald vor mehr und mehr Br\u00fcckenfallen, die man jedoch mit Steinen wieder begehbar machen kann. Wer zuerst alle seine Spielfiguren in das gegen\u00fcberliegende Dorf gebracht hat, wird schlie\u00dflich Sieger.",

You can build residences, shops like the Confectioners, and attractions like the Penny Arcade! You'll also need to employ citizens to generate income for your lane. Penny Lane also has a tableau-building component, where players can get bonus points or currency by aligning their buildings with different \"links.\"\n\nEach round consists of an action phase followed by an upkeep phase. In the action phase, a player can either select a Main Street action or pass. The action phase repeats until each player has passed.\n\nTo take a Main Street action, a player must choose from the communal Main Street cards, and place the required number of pennies on the open action space. The player then carries out the effect of that card. Possible actions include purchasing a building, placing a worker, rearranging buildings, or claiming the Mayor meeple to become the new 1st player.\n\nEach player places purchase buildings in their lane. If they're able to connect a penny link, they get an extra penny at the end of each upkeep phase. If they're able to connect a victory point link, they get an extra victory point at the end of the game.\n\nIn the upkeep phase, all players gain 1 penny. Players then resolve all effects in their lane as indicated by the upkeep symbol and their penny links.\n\nThe final round is triggered when one player has 10 or more points on their lane, and the player with the most victory points wins!",

You can build residences, shops like the Confectioners, and attractions like the Penny Arcade! You'll also need to employ citizens to generate income for your lane. Penny Lane also has a tableau-building component, where players can get bonus points or currency by aligning their buildings with different \"links.\"\n\nEach round consists of an action phase followed by an upkeep phase. In the action phase, a player can either select a Main Street action or pass. The action phase repeats until each player has passed.\n\nTo take a Main Street action, a player must choose from the communal Main Street cards, and place the required number of pennies on the open action space. The player then carries out the effect of that card. Possible actions include purchasing a building, placing a worker, rearranging buildings, or claiming the Mayor meeple to become the new 1st player.\n\nEach player places purchase buildings in their lane. If they're able to connect a penny link, they get an extra penny at the end of each upkeep phase. If they're able to connect a victory point link, they get an extra victory point at the end of the game.\n\nIn the upkeep phase, all players gain 1 penny. Players then resolve all effects in their lane as indicated by the upkeep symbol and their penny links.\n\nThe final round is triggered when one player has 10 or more points on their lane, and the player with the most victory points wins!",

Each player fights over four categories \u2014 pure, dawn, spiral, and faith \u2014 that correspond to four colors; there are 12 cards with the value 1-3 in each category, and the cards are dealt so that each player has a mix of the same value cards in their deck, with some cards being secretly removed from play.\n\nOn a player's turn, they present two cards from their hand face up. The opponent takes one of those cards and places it on their side of the board, adding to their power in that category; the other card is added to the score for that category at the end of the game. Players alternate turns until all of the cards have been distributed, then players see who has the most strength in each category. The winner of a category wins all the points in that category, and whoever collects the most points wins the game.",

Perhaps you even saw a fireball engulf a fellow traveler in a hellscape of horror that makes you afraid to close your eyes at night. Whatever the case, welcome back! Turns out that Vul-Kar didn't like having his gem stolen way back when, so there has been some volcanic upheaval, an explosion in our snake population, feral tigers, new types of trees bent on ending human life, and swarms of bees everywhere. But don't worry \u2014 we have top people working on it.\n\nStart your day of adventure at the helipad. Be sure to sign the waiver, which legally obligates you to take snapshots across the island. You'll race down the many paths, avoiding hazards all the while. On the plus side, you get to keep all the treasure you find.\n\nFireball Island: The Curse of Vul-Kar is a restoration of the classic 1986 game Fireball Island that features a unique 3D island and a host of marble mayhem. This new version boasts an island that is even bigger than the original (and yet fits in a smaller box) and more marbles. It is a family-weight game for 2-4 players (5 with an expansion) that plays in 30-45 minutes. Simple card play replaces the random roll-and-move of the original, and the set collection for the treasures offers some interesting choices for players.\n\nRemember, you don't have to outrun the fireball \u2014 just the other players.\n\n\u2014description from the publisher\n\n\nBienvenue sur l'\u00cele Infernale !

                    "description": "User summary:\n\nTheme - A fortune telling game based on cards and pendulum. Played solo or between two players with roles of questioner (later on just Q) and interpreter (N). The interpreter leads the game and the questioner is the one receiving information about his/her home, work, personality, love, future and past.\n\nGame-play - The game-play is divided into two phases 1) the card turning and 2) the pendulum swinging.\n\n1) The card turning phase starts by picking up the proper coloured scarabs to the game board; the hair, eyes and favourite colour of the Q. The Q shuffles the purple 54 card deck and hands it over to N. N divides the deck into 3 separate decks of 18, 9 and 27 cards. The cards are dealt on the game board in the order 18, 27 and 9. The 18 cards are dealt on locations shown at the front page of the rule leaflet. The cards have 6 words in them and one of those is picked depending which is forming a pyramid with the game board (the black half of the pyramid on the left side of the card and the white half of the pyramid on the game board). While the cards are dealt, the N questions the Q if the word on the cards have any special meaning. The forming words are related to either home (1st vertical row), work (2nd), personality (3rd), love (4th), future (5th) or past (6th), depending which vertical row the cards are placed to. The 27 cards are then dealt on the game board (some restrictions apply, see the rule leaflet). Then the deck of 9 cards is used as a key to whole interpretation. At last the rest cards of the deck of 27 are used to check if something is being dominant on some areas of the Q's life. The final interpretations varies each playing time.\n\n2) The pendulum swinging phase starts by placing the four decks of 28 cards onto the game board. The decks are placed on lower part of the game board, around the pyramid (letter A shown on the first page of the rule leaflet). The decks represents the areas of home, work, personality and love. The players decide one of the four categories and Q decides a question he/she wants to get answered related to that category. The transparent pyramid is placed on the game board and the pendulum is used for random number selection. There is numbers of 1-28 around the pyramid on the game board and the random pendulum swing decides the number of the chosen card. The N reads the text on the proper card to the Q. Same is repeated to other categories and questions.\n\nGoal of the game - Interpreting the message gotten with cards and pendulum and gaining more self-consciousness.\n\nThe game includes:\n\n1 game board\n1 transparent pyramid\n1 pendulum\n4 decks of cards (28 cards each)\n1 purple deck of cards (54 cards)\n2 bags including different coloured scarab buttons\n1 rule leaflet (4 pages)\n\nFrom Finnish intro on the rule leaflet:\n\n\"Karnak on kiehtovan j\u00e4nnitt\u00e4v\u00e4 ennustuspeli, jota voi pelata yksin tai yhdess\u00e4. Se perustuu er\u00e4isiin muinaisegyptil\u00e4isiin mysteereihin ja kulttuuriperinteisiin.

                    "description": "One of the games playable with the Katarenga board and pieces is Colorado. This game is invented by the author of Katarenga himself and was the original design of Katarenga before development.\n\nThe game starts with players lining their pawns across from one another at either side of the 8 x 8 grid. The goal of the game is to be the first player to get all of their remaining, surviving pawns across the board to their opponent's baseline (referred to as the player's \"home\" row), or by capturing all eight of your opponent's pawns.\n\nEach turn, players choose one of their pawns and move it according to the type of space it is moving from. Once a player gets a pawn to the opposite baseline, their opponent may, if possible, use their next move to capture it. If this pawn was not captured immediately, it becomes invulnerable so long as it remains on the same homing square. It can be moved again, whether or not to another square on the home rank, but every time it lands on a square on that rank it again becomes vulnerable to capture for one move only.\n\nThe game ends as soon as one player wins by getting their last remaining pawn home, by capturing the last remaining enemy pawn, or (unusually) when their last remaining unhomed pawn is captured, at least one of the others being already home. These various win conditions create for interesting strategies and razor-tight balance between capturing and blocking.\n\n\u2014user summary",

In this turn-based card game, the players build their Mindsets, filling it up with Bliss or Gloom Emotions. The outside world is represented by the Impulse, a dynamically changing pool of available Emotion cards. Whenever the Impulse is emptied of Emotions, each player's Mindset is scored, granting Bliss or Gloom Identity Fragments. The goal of the game is to collect enough Fragments to fully develop the Identity.\n\nPlayers can get Fragments by invoking Emotions into their Mindset, however, these Fragments can be spent for the effect of the Emotions' Abilities, so it is up to the players to decide wether they hold on to their victory points or spend some of them to be more efficient. Emotion effects can interact with other Mindsets, other players' hands, the Impulse, but can be cancelled by discarding Emotions of the matching type.\n\nThe game ends if one of the players manages to build a fully single-minded (collecting eight or more of one type of Fragment) or a balanced personality (collecting five or more of both Fragment types).\n\nThe game consists of 96 Emotion cards, 80 Identity Fragments, 5 player aid cards and a Mood Marker.\n\n\u2014description from the publisher",

                    "description": "As Bliss and Gloom struggle for control of the Inside World, a new force enters the fray. Neither judge nor spectator, Balance is an active participant, striving to ensure that no side achieves dominance. Both Bliss and Gloom are important for the health of Cerebria, and Balance seeks a way for them to coexist in harmony.\n\nThe Forces of Balance expansion extends the world of Cerebria by adding a third side to the game with two new Spirits; unpredictable Intuition and wise Reason. The Balance game mode makes it possible for six players to play at once, and it also works for fewer numbers of players.\n\nThe Balance side has also some new mechanics. Their Emotions, the way they Invoke Emotions, gain Essence or Fortify are all uniquely tied to the playstyle of Balance.\n\nBalance players have their own method to gather final scores during the game. They do not compete for the Common Aspiration. Instead, they have a Hidden Aspiration with two equivalent conditions. Just like Bliss and Gloom, Balance wins by having the most points at the end of the game from Identity Fragments and the Wheel of Intentions.\n\n\u2014description from the publisher",

They run the household and they have the last word at home in the tents. Different families are divided into tribes, headed by the \u2018Imascheren\u2019 (or nobles). As leader of a Tuareg tribe, players trade goods from near (such as dates and salt) and far (like pepper), in order to obtain gold and other benefits, and enlarge their family. In each round their new offerings are made. Cards are a means to an end, in order to obtain the popular tribe cards.\n\nGameplay:\n\nThe board consists of a 5x5 grid: a border of 16 squares with printed action symbols and then 9 blank squares in the centre onto which cards are dealt. Meeples are placed one at a time on the spaces at the edges of the board (not including corner squares). You cannot place a meeple on a square the opponent has a meeple on already, nor on a square facing opponent's meeple. Once all meeples are placed, players then execute the actions on the border squares the meeples are on and also take the cards from the centre that match the row and column of the border meeples.\n\nThe game is predominantly scored and won by playing tribal cards to your display. These give advantages during the game and victory points at the end. Usually cards are played (or discarded) immediately once drawn. A single card can be kept in hand but then requires a special action to play it (or to discard it to free the hand spot for another card). Each card has a cost in goods to play. Goods are obtained either from border spaces or from goods cards.\n\nThe display (for scoring) consists of 3 rows of 4 cards that are filled from left to right and cannot be moved once placed (barring some special cards). There is also a balance to be found between the victory point score on the cards themselves (1-3 VP per tribal card) and in the combinations per row (a full row of 4 identical card types gets you an additional 4 VP, and a full row of 4 distinct card types gets you 2 VP).\n\nThe winner at the end of the game is the player with the most victory points.",

No one knows which ships you're betting on to bring in the biggest haul, but at the same time, you're in the dark as to what the other fishermen are doing, too.\n\nAt the start of the game, each player receives seven cards from a deck of 28, with each color appearing four times. Players simultaneously pass one card to the left. The four colors of cards match the colors of ships that start in the harbor. Six cards are shuffled and laid in a row from the harbor, with each card having 0-3 fish. Each player starts with one resource cube, and 15 journey tiles are shuffled and laid face down.\n\nOn a turn, you announce that you're revealing 1-3 journey tiles \u2014 gaining a resource cube if you say 1 and paying one if you say 3. You then reveal those tiles, then move one of the ships depicted on one tile one space forward. (Alternatively, if you reveal the pirate tile, all other players must discard a resource cube.) Instead of revealing tile, you can discard one of your cards in hand face down to move one ship forward or backward one space. You cannot move a ship to the final space this way. If fewer than four tiles are face down at the start of your turn, place them all face down, shuffle them, then continue.\n\nWhen a ship reaches the final space, the game ends. Each player then reveals their cards, and each card is worth as many fish as the space occupied by the ship of the same color. Whoever has caught the most total fish wins!",

In the game, which is played out on a scrolling space backdrop, the players take on the roles of brave space pilots sweeping around in nimble yet powerful fighters, searching the asteroid clusters for universal glory and ancient technology. Players compete to obtain the most glory, with glory resulting from carrying out missions, finding lost treasure in asteroid clusters, and destroying alien entities, not to mention other players.\n\nIn the game, players fly through an ever-scrolling space setting, which is represented by rows of cards. Each turn, the bottom row is removed and a new row is added to the top. Players move their spaceships and resolve effects continuously, performing actions such as collecting power-ups and money, fighting alien cruisers and titans, blocking and shooting other players, and dodging asteroids and black holes. The players need to balance the use of their ships' energy as it's used for both absorbing enemy fire and boosting their movement speed and fire rate.\n\nThe game includes missions and achievements as well as a mechanism called \"threat level\" to keep everyone in suspense throughout the whole game. Threat allows players to enjoy the satisfaction of both shooting wildly at each other and dodging the hundreds of bullets raining down from enemy fighters and other players.\n\nAll player ships are fully upgradeable with four different weapon classes, engines, shields and more. Each player must buy the upgrades and navigate the path that best fits his chosen strategy in order to successfully complete his missions and attain the most glory.",

How high will you bid before the tension and bluffing get to you? And how good's your eye --- can you spot a forgery when you buy one?\n\nThe MASTERPIECE game combines the excitement of a fast-paced board game with the glamour and sophistication of a game that deals with fine art. Some of the world's greatest paintings, illustrated in full-color postcards, are an integral part of gameplay.\n\nThe high-stakes world of international art --- and the power plays of an auction --- will entertain and enlighten as you join a particularly eccentric group of collectors who've all come in search of a MASTERPIECE.\n\nEach player takes the role of an art collector and tries to amass the greatest fortune in cash and the value of art pieces in their collection.\n\nThe painting cards are randomized and placed face down in a stack. Matching size value cards are also mixed and placed face down in a stack. These value cards indicate the worth of the painting ranging from forgery (zero) to $1,000,000. Each player receives an equal sum of money and one painting with value card which are clipped together so that all players can see the painting and only the owning player can see the value. When paintings are drawn from the stack, a value card is clipped to them in this fashion. Players move around the board by die roll and land on spaces that allow the player to collect money from the bank, receive a painting from the stack, sell a painting to the bank for its value, sell a painting to the bank for a specified amount, auction one of their paintings to the highest bidding opponent, or auction the top painting in the stack to the highest bidder.\n\nThe game ends when the painting stack is exhausted. Players add the values of their paintings to their cash on hand. The player with the largest total wins.",

Be the first to reach supremacy in one field to make history, but keep an eye on how your opponents are advancing. Forming a temporary alliance might be the best way to keep a player from triumphing\u2026and remember that offense is sometimes the best defense!\n\nIn more detail, a player wins when they reach supremacy in a field; if this doesn't happen, when no more cards can be drawn, the game ends and players go through a majority scoring to determine the winner.\n\nCIV includes six fields of competition: Army, Religion, Economics, Science, Culture, and Utopia. The 104 cards in the game are split in three ages, which represent the natural evolution of global civilization through the timeline, but the cards of each field aren't split equally. Once the second age has finished, for example, if you haven't yet reached supremacy of Religion, it's time to think about another strategy.\n\nEach field gives powers to the player who succeeds in reaching the limit of cards in their play area (depending on the number of players). There are different kinds of powers, two levels of permanent effects, and one sacrifice effect for each field. Using these powers in combination will be necessary to be the first to reach supremacy \u2014 but using these powers is also a way to keep competitors from reaching victory.\n\nYou will need all your diplomacy skills to get help from others and prevent the leading player from winning, yet today's friend could be tomorrow's enemy, so pay attention to all and think about which combination of powers might lead to a surprise victory! Be the first to use it!\n\nThe game includes rules for 1v1 play, 2v2 team play, and 3-4 player games.",

An older player reads a story and when any of the figures is named, each player tries to be the first to grab it. If the figure has already been named, the player takes a marker instead. At the end of the story the player with the most pieces wins.\n\nIn the second game, the pieces are laid out in an order and the player must identify them to get a point.\n\nThe last game is one of remembering which pieces have been named.\n\nIt is similar to the earlier Ratz-Fatz and some of the scenarios can be used to make a larger combined game, so in some ways this is an expansion kit.\n\nIntegrates with:\n\nRatz-Fatz",

As their skeletons and zombies battle, the Necromancers use their powers to take control of enemy units! The goal: to find the mystic Jewels of Power - and destroy the enemy Necromancer.\n\nA unique combat system varies the power of a player's troops according to the number of units he controls; the more undead you control, the weaker each unit is. All counters are back-printed, since any unit may change sides.\n\n(from the back of the box)\n\nOriginally published in The Space Gamer #55, September 1982.",

It was called the Alamo and the deeds that occurred there in early March helped to shape the destiny of the United States of America. But the Alamo was only the most famous of the battles that occurred during the Texas War of Independence. And now with Deguello you can recreate history and relive the sharp struggle for Texas independence.\n\nBy generating the scenarios for you, DEGUELLO lets you link all your combats into one long continuous story. Easy to learn game mechanics and a unique \"reaction system\" combine to make every game different.\n\nSet an ambush, pursue the enemy, or defend the walls, it\u2019s all here for you. Playable with any already based figures DEGUELLO can be played solo or with others.\n\nThe Mexican band strikes up the \u201cDeguello\u201d, the Spanish tune for \u201cno quarter\u201d. The battle is about to begin. Are you ready?\"\n\nSimple miniatures game for Texas War of Independence.",

The Influence Card deck is shuffled and each player is dealt five cards face down. The player whose Investor is first in alphabetical order goes first. The player to the starting player\u2019s right places the Dollar marker on any space on the game board.\n\nEach space on the game board represents a potential deal which Investors have to approve the deal and the number of dividends to be paid to those investors.\n\nOn one\u2019s turn, a player can open negotiations on the deal where the Dollar marker rests or roll the six-sided die. If the player rolls the die, the Dollar marker is advanced clockwise around the game board counting the available deals as spaces. Once the Dollar marker rests, the player may try to negotiate that deal or draw three Influence cards. If by drawing cards, the player\u2019s hand exceeds twelve the player chooses which cards to discard to the limit.\n\nShould a player choose to make the deal, the player negotiates with the player or players representing the Investors how to divide the money at stake. The amount is number of dividends written on the space multiplied by value of the shares written on the deal tile. Any or all of the players may use their Influence cards to affect the outcome of the deal:\n\n\u2022 Clan cards may act in place of Investors whether the Investors are in play or not.\n\u2022 Travel cards put Investors out of play for the negotiations. Some are specific for a given Investor; some are wild to be played on any Investor.\n\u2022 Recruitment cards can only be played in sets of three to steal another player\u2019s Investor and make it your own.\n\u2022 Boss cards give the player control of the negotiations.\n\u2022 Stop cards immediately stop the effects of Travel, Recruitment, and Boss Influence cards.\n\nThe players are paid from the bank when a deal has been struck. The game board space is covered with the Deal tile (effectively closing the space from further game play), the Dollar marker is moved to the next open space, and play continues with next player.\n\nOnce nine deals have been made, a die is rolled after each subsequent deal to determine whether the game ends (with the odds increasing each time). Victory goes to whoever has the biggest bankroll!",

It is played on a map that is a simplified terrain reproduction of the actual battlefield, A grid of hexagons printed over the map is used to regulate movement much as the squares on a chess board. The pieces in the game represent the actual military units that took pare in the historical conflict. The large numbers on the pieces indicate the relative strengths of these units. Each Player maneuvers his pieces on the map to engage those of the enemy. Battles take place when units are adjacent to enemy units. The total relative strengths of the involved units are compared. The attacking Player consults a simple probability table (the Combat Results Table) to determine the outcome of each battle. Then the other Player moves his units and conducts attacks. The game proceeds this ways (for a specified number of turns) as the Players try to achieve the historical objectives set forth in the rules. The final outcome of the game can be very different from the actual historical result. No prior knowledge of history or military tactics is required to play the game - just a little ingenuity and common sense.\n\nOne of four games included in the Napoleon At War QuadriGame. The games in this set are based on the Napoleon At Waterloo system.",

There are also cheat cards that can be used to gain an advantage on other players when they least expect it. When players are killed they respawn on their next turn and the first player to score three kills is the winner.",

In each of the 16 intersections between four spaces, there is a post holding a door that can swing around so that it blocks access between any adjacent two spaces of the four spaces around it. Each player has five balls on his side of the board. The object is to move the balls across the board, at which point they are removed from the game. To move, you must push a ball through a door. If there is a ball in the space beyond the door, it will be pushed -- this can cascade indefinitely. But a move is only legal as long as each ball lands either in an empty space or goes through another door -- balls cannot touch each other. The winner is either the first person to remove all his balls from the board, or the player with the fewest balls left when no legal moves remain.",

Expertly create puck clusters and you could double, triple and even quadruple your score.\"\n\nEach player has a stack of magnetic pucks. The object for two (or more people in teams) to take turns flicking the pucks and land them on numbered scoring zones. The strategy is to flip the pucks over when flicking so that they will either pull/adhere to another puck on the field or repel a puck off of a scoring zone. When all pucks have been flicked, each player scores all pucks that are in their scoring zone on the board.\n\nAnother way to describe it is head to head magnetic shuffleboard.",

                    "description": "Get rid of the rats and go for the cats! In Rat-a-Tat Cat, less is always better, and you want to go out with the lowest score. Can you remember the numbers on the other players' cards? Can you keep a poker face, but notice when another player looks pleased? Sharpen your memory and your timing, and have fun with the cool cats and bad rats of Rat-a-Tat Cat. This is the Gamewright version.\n\n1996 Mensa Select\n\nRepublished 2002 by Amigo as Biberbande:\n\nBiberbande is a card game for Ages 6 and up, the object of which is to improve your initial unknown 4-card hand so that you have a lower sum of cards than the other players. There are 66 cards in the deck, which consists of ranks 0-9 (four of ranks 0-8 and nine 9's) and 3 different types of action cards (9 \"Exchange\", 7 \"Spy\", and 5 \"2 X draw\"). Four cards are dealt face down to each player so that no player knows the values of her cards. The four cards are then arranged in a row and each player may briefly look at her outer two cards. A player's turn consists of drawing a card from the top of the draw pile or discard pile. If the player drew from the draw pile, there are several possible actions: If it is a number card, she may replace one of her face down cards with it (placing it face down) or she may simply discard it. If it is an action card, she may carry out the action or ignore the action. If a player draws the top card of the discard pile, she must replace one of her face down cards with it (placed face down). A player may knock at the end of her turn meaning that each other player has one more turn before the round is over. When the round ends, players turn over their cards and add up their values. The player with the lowest total value wins. Generally the game is played with as many rounds as there are players. Player interaction comes in the form of the action cards. The 'Exchange' card allows a player to exchange one of his cards with one of his opponents. The 'Spy' card allows a player to look at one of his own cards. Finally the \"2X look\" card allows a player to look at the top card of the draw pile, then keep it or throw it away. If she throws it away, she must use the next card in the draw pile.",

In 2008, Avalon Hill released a 50th anniversary edition with a new map and cardboard pieces representing the armies and navies.\n\nIn the game, players represent one of the seven \"Great Powers of Europe\" (Great Britain, France, Austria-Hungary, Germany, Italy, Russia or Turkey) in the years prior to World War I. Play begins in the Spring of 1901, and players make both Spring and Autumn moves each year. There are only two kinds of military units: armies and fleets. On any given turn, each of your military units has limited options: they can move into an adjoining territory, support an allied unit in an attack on an adjoining territory, support an allied unit in defending an adjoining territory, or hold their position. Players instruct each of their units by writing a set of \"orders.\" The outcome of each turn is determined by the rules of the game. There are no dice rolls or other elements of chance. With its incredibly simplistic movement mechanics fused to a significant negotiation element, this system is highly respected by many gamers.\n\nAvalon Hill Complexity rating - 3\n\nRe-implemented by:\n\nColonial Diplomacy\nDiplomacy: Classical Variant\nDiplomacy: Hundred Variant",

Each player is given a card with seven words in a category, and a wipe-off board with space for clues for each of them. Players then attempt to write the shortest possible clues for their seven words. In turn, each player puts his or her board in the display rack. After announcing the category, their teammates have a limited amount of time to guess the words. If any are left unanswered, the other team is given a single shot to guess each word\n\nWon Games Magazine Game of the Year award in 1993.\n1993 Mensa Select",

The Justice League of America is ready for action \u2013 are you? Fight the never-ending battle for truth, justice, and peace in the DC Comics Deck-Building Game!\n\nTo start the game, each player chooses one of the seven over-sized hero cards, each of which has a special power, and starts with a deck of ten cards. Each turn, a player starts with a hand of five cards and can acquire or conquer the five types of cards in the game: heroes, villains and super-villains, equipment, super powers, and locations. To defeat villains, you'll need to have power \u2013 but when a super-villain is defeated, a new one comes into play, attacking all the heroes while doing so. Make sure you've acquired defenses \u2013 like superspeed or bulletproof powers, or The Batsuit equipment \u2013 to protect yourself from harm.\n\nCraft your hero deck into a well-oiled machine to take on the most vile villains in the DC Universe in your quest for victory (points)!",

Originally published in Strategy & Tactics issue #140 (February 1991).\n\nThe game is an Operational level simulation of the World War II battles fought during late 1942 between Axis and Allied forces for control of Tunis. Victory by the Allies would have led to Rommel's army in Libya being trapped and the war in North Africa being shortened. The period covered starts November 11th and ends December 9th 1942. There are two shorter scenarios (\"Spearhead\" and \"Battle for the Ports\") and one that covers the whole period.\n\nThe other games in the series are: Decision At Kasserine, O'Connor's Offensive, Hellfire Pass, Rommel at Bay, Patton Goes to War, and Race For Tunis.\n\nGame Scale:\nTurn: 12 hours\nHex: 2 miles / 3.2 km\nUnit: Platoon to Battalion\n\nGame Inventory:\nOne 22\" X 34\" mapsheet\nOne countersheet (200 1/2\" counters)\nOne 20 page rules booklet",

Stay tuned to see what new tricks our arena master has in store for today's battle. Here comes the first team. Oh my, they seem to be even uglier than our usual competitors. Who thought it was a good idea to match chain tracks with a poison needle? That team will need a lot of help from their sponsor to have a chance. Look at their opponents, tentacles with anti-matter flail \u2014 that's a classic. Seems like we are ready to start. It's time to freak out!\n\nIn Space Freaks, you are team manager of one of the fighting teams sponsored by powerful megacorporations. Your task is to combine different body parts to design the perfect freak, then lead your team of freaks to victory. The arena is controlled by the arena master, who each turn changes the conditions in the arena. To succeed, you need to complete tasks given to you by the viewers \u2014 or just destroy the other freaks and their base. But don't worry because in Space Freaks everyone wins, either by managing the winning team or by becoming a (body)part of the next winning team!\n\nIn more detail, during the game you build your own freaks, one body part at a time, in addition to building turrets, bunkers and droids to aid your team. Your team sponsor might also aid you in the form of items, special actions, or even alien marauders. You score points during play by fulfilling tasks given to your team by the viewers, killing competing freaks, destroying an opposing base, or controlling the center of the arena.",

But never ever underestimate the power of the dice!\n\nIn each round on Ci\u00fab, you will try to make your dice show the combination on one of the spell cards in order to gain victory points. Different faces on the various dice will aid you. After you gain a spell, you will usually need to reduce the number of your dice, so planning ahead for the next round is key.

                    "description": "Aquileia, the second most important city of the Roman Empire, had been originally founded as an outpost against the Barbarian invaders. From its military origin comes the peculiar quadrilateral structure divided by the main streets. Later, the city developed to become an important political and cultural center and a prosperous trading city, especially for precious goods, thanks to its convenient and efficient river port. Important monuments such as the Gladiator Arena, the horse-racing Stadium, and the famous theater were built, as well as craftsmen's workshops, patrician villas which completed the architectural network of the city.\n\nIn Aquileia, players want to become the most powerful figure in the city by trading and building. Each player, representing a wealthy Aquileian patrician, owns a certain number of henchmen (pawns) which he uses for these main activities: sports playing, culture, trading, and building. Each activity can bring expenses, earnings and sometimes victory points (VPs).\n\nEach round begins with a placement phase in which players take turns placing their henchmen on action spaces and their tiebreaker disc on the tiebreaker track. Placing the tiebreaker is mandatory; placing henchmen is not (but you probably want to place them). Once everyone has passed or placed all of their tokens, players resolve the action spaces in numerical order:\n\n\nThe Mercatus allows players to buy weapons, arms and slave cards, collect money through a die roll, claim four blue dice for use with the Arena and Stadium, and trade one currency for another. (This is the only way to make change, and some actions require specific currencies; if you must pay bronze and have only silver and gold, then you cannot take that action!)\nAt the Arena, players compare fighting strength, with that number determined by the starting strength on the action space claimed, the roll of three dice and the playing of slave and weapon cards. The winner gets three bronze coins and either double his strength in VPs or a slave card. The second and third best players receive lesser rewards.\nThe Stadium is similar to the Arena, with the horse cards coming into play and the winner receiving gold or silver coins and his choice of two laurel cards; laurel cards deliver 3-10 VPs or are a multiplier for endgame scoring.\nThe Theatrum brings a bid for a dual-colored laurel card, with players needing to ante and raise in particular currencies.\nIn the Forum, players build villas and private banks, sometimes scoring points for doing so when they pay the specific costs with the proper coins.\nFinally, the Portus gives players a chance to activate their buildings, thereby earning them VPs or money.\n\n\nAfter six rounds, the game ends and players score VPs for their hidden point cards and the product of their villas' values times laurel cards of a matching color. (For example, a total of 8 points of blue villas and three blue villa cards equals 24 points.) The player with the most victory points wins.",

You love it.\n\nThis award-winning card game, designed by Steve Jackson, captures the essence of the dungeon experience... with none of that stupid roleplaying stuff. You and your friends compete to kill monsters and grab magic items. And what magic items! Don the Horny Helmet and the Boots of Butt-Kicking. Wield the Staff of Napalm... or maybe the Chainsaw of Bloody Dismemberment. Start by slaughtering the Potted Plant and the Drooling Slime, and work your way up to the Plutonium Dragon...\n\nAnd it's illustrated by John Kovalic! Fast-playing and silly, Munchkin can reduce any roleplaying group to hysteria. And, while they're laughing, you can steal their stuff.\n\n\nOther\n\nPart of the Munchkin series.\n\nMunchkin is a satirical card game based on the clich\u00e9s and oddities of Dungeons and Dragons and other role-playing games. Each player starts at level 1 and the winner is the first player to reach level 10. Players can acquire familiar D&D style character classes during the game which determine to some extent the cards they can play.\n\nThere are two types of cards - treasure and encounters. Each turn the current players 'kicks down the door' - drawing an encounter card from the deck. Usually this will involve battling a monster. Monsters have their own levels and players must try and overcome it using the levels, weapons and powers they have acquired during the game or run away. Other players can chose to help the player or hinder by adding extra monsters to the encounter. Defeating a monster will usually result in drawing treasure cards and acquiring levels. Being defeated by a monster results in \"bad stuff\" which usually involves losing levels and treasure.\n\nIn May 2010, Steve Jackson Games made the \"big announcement.\" Many rules and cards were changed. See The Great 2010 Munchkin Changeover for details. Of note to Munchkin fans, the Kneepads of Allure card, which had been removed in the 14th printing, was added back to the game but modified to be less powerful.\n\n\nSequels:\n\n\nThe Good, the Bad, and the Munchkin\nMunchkin Apocalypse\nMunchkin Axe Cop\nMunchkin Bites!\nMunchkin Booty\nMunchkin Conan\nMunchkin Cthulhu\nMunchkin Fu\nMunchkin Impossible\nMunchkin Legends\nMunchkin Pathfinder\nMunchkin Zombies\nStar Munchkin\nSuper Munchkin\n\n\n\nRelated Board Games\n\n\nMunchkin Quest\n\n\n\nOnline play\n\n\nVassal does not support Munchkin anymore. Former link: Vassal Module\n\n\n\nPegasus Expansions\n\n\nMunchkin Sammlerbox\nMunchkin Sammlerkoffer\nMunchkin Promotional Bookmarks\nMunchkin Weihnachtsedition - The same as Munchkin, but with a promotional button that grants the wearer extra treasure (when worn in December).\n\n\n\nOnline Playthrough\n\nThere's a great YouTube playthrough with Will Wheaton and Steve Jackson (yes, the Steve Jackson) found here LINK",

To begin, you take Picture Disks (depicting Bozo and his friends) and place them on the faces of the gears. On your turn, you spin the spinner and rotate the center gear a number of notches equal to the number spun. You then check all the disks to see if any figures are standing on their heads (upside-down). If there are, you remove and keep them, replacing them with new discs from the stack. The player with the most discs, when they've all been removed, is the winner.",

                    "description": "The game of Alquerque is played on a special board of 5 x 5 points with lines between them to indicate allowed moves. To draw a board is easy. First draw a 5 x 5 orthogonal grid. The draw two diagonal lines - from each corner to the opposite corner. Finally draw four diagonal lines in the form of a square that connects the midpoints of each side.\nAlquerque is played with 12 black pieces and 12 white pieces in a similar way to Draughts (Checkers).\nThe player playing black pieces places them on the 10 points of the nearest 2 rows plus the 2 rightmost points on the middle row as the player looks at it. The other player sets the white pieces up in exactly the same way. This leaves only the middle point without a piece upon it. The objective of the game is to take all of the opponent's pieces or to produce a position such that the opponent is unable to move.\n\nPlay\nPlayers take turns to move one of their pieces. A piece may only move along the lines inscribed upon the board. For each turn a piece makes either a capturing move or an ordinary move.\nWhenever a piece has an opponent's piece adjacent to it and the point immediately beyond the opponent's piece is vacant, the opponent's piece can be captured. A piece is taken by simply hopping over it into the vacant point beyond and removing it from the board. Unlike an ordinary move, a capturing move can consist of several such hops - if a piece takes an opponent's piece and the new position allows it to take another piece, then it can do so straight away. The move finishes when the position of the capturing piece no longer allows it to taken any more pieces or the player could make another capture but decides not to.\n\nAn ordinary move is made by simply moving a piece along a line to an adjacent point.\nFinishing\nThe game is won by the player who first manages to take all his opponent's pieces or by the player who has more pieces when it becomes apparent that no more pieces will be taken. Alternatively, a player can win by rendering the other player unable to move.\nA draw occurs by agreement at any point during the game. If it becomes apparent that no more pieces will be taken and both players have the same number of pieces left, a draw is agreed. Draws are very common.\n\nArie van der Stoep's reconstruction:\n\nIn his book Draughts in relation to chess and alquerque (2005) Arie van der Stoep contends that Alquerque de doze was in medieval times played by the following rules. Counters can move and capture, by the short leap, forwards and sideways. Capture is not compulsory. Counters are promoted to Sultans at the last rank. The Sultan (King) moves and captures in all directions. Counters are obliged to follow the pattern on the board. Goal is to capture all the opponent's counters.\n\nThere existed two variants of Medieval Alquerque. In one version the Sultan can only move one square (short Sultan), and captures by the short leap. This was foremostly played in countries within the Roman sphere of influence. In the other variant the Sultan moves any number of squares, and captures like the King in international draughts, landing anywhere behind the captured piece. This was foremostly played in countries within the Arabic sphere of influence. In Sultan endgames, a majority of at least two Sultans is necessary for a win.",

Besides their schemes and secret agendas, they fight a power struggle for the most valuable resource that is known to sentiment beings: Crystallium. This substance fuels all Magitech, an invention that grants godlike powers by fusing magic and technology. Mighty legions and armadas of spaceships became obsolete within the blink of an eye, as the Technomagi tapped into the possibilities of Magitech. In the far away future, battles are fought and decided by a selected few instead. Accompanied by their Minions, Technomagi strive for nothing less than ultimate rulership over the universe. And Crystallium is the key to victory...\"\n\nSUMMARY OF PLAY\n\nIn \"The Magitech Wars\" - players take the roles of mighty Technomagi - competing to claim Crystallium Sources on the plane, through skirmish battles. Using customized Vaults of cards, a hex-tile gameboard, six sided dice and tokens, they let their minions fight to become the emperor of a fictitious multiverse. From turn to turn the players summon Minions and move them around the board to let them battle. Players gain crystals by putting some of their Minions into the crystal zone, and win the game through gathering six victory points. Those points are scored by controlling the most Places of Power on the gameboard, or by banishing enemy cards.\n\nOBJECT OF THE GAME\n\nThe first player who scores six Victory Points, wins the game. This is done in two different ways:\n\n\nControl Places of Power.\nBanish enemy cards.",

It can be played by two, four or six players either singly, in pairs or teams of three. The components of the game are 36 different octagonal tiles or metagons and a playing board.\n\nThe object of Metagon is to gain tiles from the playing ground. This can be achieved in either of two ways.\n\n1. The simplest way of winning tiles is to create a straight line with three adjacent tiles having the same coloured motifs in the same relative position on each tile. Lines may be horizontal, vertical or diagonal. When a player has formed a straight line, he removes the two tiles placed earlier in the line and places these in a separate 'scoring stack', face up.\n\n2. The second way of gaining tiles is to form a parallelogram by aligning the same coloured motifs on four tiles in the same relative position on each tile. Parallelograms may be any size and aligned horizontally, vertically or diagonally. When a player has placed a parallelogram he removes the three tiles placed earlier and adds these to his scoring stack.\n\nThe game ends when players have placed all their playing stack tiles on the board. The player with the most tiles in his scoring stack is the winner.",

Stock rises as shares are bought and fall as shares are sold.\n\nA player rolls the dice and the space on which the pawn lands tells the player which stock a player may purchase. A player buys and sells stock in lots of one hundred thousand. Certain spaces allow players to buy stock in any company. Other spaces allow a player to draw a \"Tip\" which reveal which stock will change and allow the player to react accordingly.\n\nThe players decide before the game begins what will end the game but the object is to gain the most wealth.

Beyond the reach of Allied intelligence and bomber commands, the Germans establish a secret facility, where a terrifying weapon is being tested. V-2, Hitler's Wunderwaffe, a ballistic missile able to wipe London from the map and win the war, bringing Britain to her knees. But the deepest secrets of German war technology are revealed by the UK's staunchest allies - the Poles...\n\nCzas Honoru: Operacja Most III \u2013 a.k.a. Days of Honor: Operation Wildhorn III \u2013 is a fast-paced, tactical card wargame for two players. The first player takes the role of the Polish commander. His goal is to collect fragments from rockets test-fired from the German missile base. The second player takes the role of the German commander and is trying to protect the secrets of the rocket testing area.\n\nThe game lasts four turns. Each turn begins with a missile test, which scatters new fragments of the rocket in the peripheral area surrounding the testing ground. Players alternately take turns during which they place their units on the table and perform actions. Players use scouts to collect missile fragments, but they need to be protected by soldiers and partisans because enemy contact can lead to combat. These actions are supported by elite units: Polish Unseen and Silent commandos and German SS Stormtroopers, who are able to penetrate enemy lines. In addition, players build a network of command and support units, which allows them to effectively carry out their actions.\n\nPlayers also affect the course of the game during their opponent's moves, playing cards for immediate effects. And each side has a set of unique events, e.g., Germans can use their logistical advantages while Poles can hide, and even evacuate rocket fragments to England! To determine combat and exploration results, players each use a six-sided die, but they have many opportunities to modify the results, so a good plan should work even with bad luck.\n\nAt the end of the game, the player with more rocket parts wins. This means the player successfully stole (Polish) or concealed (German) the secrets of the V-2 weapon.",

The Pancake Queen, the Ladybug Queen, and ten of their closest friends have fallen under a sleeping spell and it's your job to wake them up.\n\nIn Sleeping Queens, players need to use strategy, quick thinking, and a little luck to rouse these napping nobles from their royal slumbers. The twelve queen cards lie face-down on the table. On a turn, you take one action from the cards in your hand: play a king to awaken and claim a sleeping queen, play a knight to steal someone else's queen (unless she has a dragon for protection), play a potion to send a queen to sleep once again (unless she has a wand for protection), use a jester to try out your luck with the top of the deck, or discard one or more number cards to draw more cards. Each queen card has a point value on it, and whenever all the required queens have been awakened or one player hits the point threshold, the game ends and whoever has the most points wins.",

Every week is a small portion of an overall larger campaign which will take many, many weeks to come to conclusion. The postcard will include a QR code or website address that will direct you to the weekly adventure document. The document will explain the setup, instructions, and key areas on the adventure map.\n\nA Path of Self-Learning uses simplistic character creation and dice rolls for combat and interacting with the world. There are a series of questions, all of which alter the final conflict of the game in various ways. On the 12th week, the adventure will be completed and to survive is to win.\n\nThe Story:\nAs punishment for a crime committed against humanity, the Lord of the land has sentenced you to a Trial of Character. You must be judged against both physical and mental challenges in which you will discover who you truly are. You will learn about the three principles, Truth, Love, and Courage. You will face moral dilemmas in each of the eight virtues where your answers must be considered carefully. Finally, you will face a mighty foe in one-on-one combat. A foe whose power is a reflection of the choices you have made. Can you prove yourself worthy to earn your mantle back, Avatar?\n\nA Path of Self-Learning is only the first adventure in a larger overall campaign. There are more aventures of different themes and new rules on the horizon.\n\n\u2014description from the publisher",

High-ranking personalities prevent the members of the opposing family from using their subjects for their own purposes and from erecting valuable buildings \u2014 but everything comes at a price. Who will lead his family to fame and honor?\n\nText from publisher:\n\nThe position of the leader of the empire is vacant. But who has what it takes to become the new king? In order to increase their power, the contenders for the throne rally the country and its people around themselves.\n\nWho will make the best use of the influence of important personalities and engage his competitors in conflicts without suffering damage himself? Rival Kings is a stalwart card game from HUCH! & friends.\n\nAt the beginning of each cycle, each player chooses one Character card and places it face down in front of him. Once all players have done so, they turn them over simultaneously. The Character cards determine the order of play, the number of possible actions, and potential conflicts. Low-ranking characters have more actions at their disposal, but they may act only after the higher-ranking characters. In addition, each character may come into conflict with certain other characters. When this happens, the higher-ranking character may take one action from the inferior character and carry it out immediately; this action is then no longer available to the lower ranked during his turn.\n\nAfter the Character cards have been played and potential conflicts have been resolved, the action phase begins. Now, depending on the action, a player can take money, get rid of Conflict markers, recruit subjects, or buy a building. Players try to secure good combinations of buildings and subjects for themselves in order to get a high score in the end. Besides this, the subjects recruited during the game provide different advantages that can have a crucial impact on the course of the game. However, only one subject is active per player \u2013 if a new Subject card is added, it covers the player's previously laid-out bonus.\n\nThe game ends as soon as one of the card piles has been depleted. The player who has collected the best combinations and has as few Conflict markers as possible lying in front of him has the best chance of assuming the throne.",

                    "description": "Tide of Iron: Next Wave was released under license by 1A Games in 2014. It is the second edition of Tide of Iron (which was first released by Fantasy Flight Games in 2007).\n\nTide of Iron: Next Wave and Tide of Iron are essentially the same game. Overall, Tide of Iron: Next Wave is much more informative and organized. The rules are improved with corrected errors which make it better than the rules found in the 2007 edition. Also, a few of the scenarios have been adjusted for better game play. These and other improvements make this edition better than the older edition. Also included in Tide of Iron: Next Wave are some additional and useful items that were later introduced to TOI in some of the game expansions. Because of these differences, the two products have different entries on BoardGameGeek. For more information about the older 2007 version of Tide of Iron, you can Click Here.\n\nTide of Iron is a game of World War II tactical conflict for two to four players. The components in this base game allow players to simulate the dramatic struggle that took place between American and German forces in Northern Europe during the years 1944 and 1945.\n\nTide of Iron is a scenario-based game, with the available forces, objectives, map, and victory conditions being set by each given scenario. It features loads of plastic figures, including soldiers, equipment, heavy weapons, and combat vehicles, cards, dice, cardboard markers, and modular game boards that will represent the customizable terrain of this scenario-based wargame.\n\nThe twelve double-sided map tiles, plus the dozens of included terrain hexes, allow for limitless potential combinations, and each scenario can be enhanced by special rules, objective markers, troop allotments, and other variations. The only limiting factor is your imagination!",

There are two variants described, a 2-6 player game as well as a 2-player version outlined in the rules.\n\nBroad appeal to children and adults due to the clear mechanics and straight-forward play.\n\nThe game utilizes 44 cards in 11 groups of four different images. Players build up their 'stash piles' by 'patenting' as many 'claims' as possible. This is accomplished by collecting sets in multiple stacks by drawing from a draw pile or common pool of 8 tiles in the center of the table based on matches and placing tiles into the pool if no match can be found.\n\nMatches can also be made with the top card of piles of any other player. The end game comes when all cards are in the possession of the players, and the stacks are consolidated to determine who has the largest stack of claims.\n\nThe 2-player variant involves repeat-dealing of four cards to players when their hands are exhausted by set collection from the pool until all cards from the deck have been utilized.\n\nReimplemented by:\n\nR\u00e4uber",

Everyone gets some number of starting cards (like 5), and must play a matching card (colour/suit/value), or pick up 1 from the 'stock' pile, and either play THAT or pass.\n\nThere are many variants, according to Hoyle. Some have 8s as the wild card (any colour/value), while other use Jacks - hence the alternate names. All seem to have at least one 'pick up #' card, and one 'skip a turn' card.\n\nVariants also include pick-up 2s, which could accumulate if more 2s were played consecutively (pick up 4, 6, or 8), and Jacks as the skip-a-turn. In other variants played with 4s as skip-a-turns, Aces as pick up 1s and Queen of Spades as pick up 5.\n\nCrazy Eights is the game upon which the commercial UNO is based.",

Taking on the roles of Naruto, Sakura, Kakashi, Rock Lee, Sai and Shikamaru from the Hidden Leaf Village, players attempt to stop the Akatsuki from extracting the tailed beasts from their bearers and using them to power their ultimate weapon: The Ged\u00f4 Maz\u00f4.\n\nIn more detail, the Akatsuki start at one of the nine villages on the game board, spend at most three turns in that village, then (if they're not defeated there) move to the next village. Each Akatsuki character has its own strengths and weaknesses. The villages are distant from one another, so players can't race from one village to another after them, but must divide their forces to prepare for conflict, encountering unexpected events along the way.\n\nEach player has a character card showing Combat Ability, Chakra Reserve, and Strategy Value, as well as an experience track that allows them to power up over time. Each character also has a deck of fourteen ability cards, some common to each deck but most unique to that character.\n\nEach turn a character takes two actions from move, meditate, or fight. When you fight, you roll dice, hoping for shuriken. You can play cards to increase the number of dice you roll, but you must spend Chakra to play them and both cards and Chakra are limited. The enemy fights back if you don't deal enough damage to it, possibly triggering special powers and additional effects in the process.\n\nOnce the Akatsuki arrive at Hidden Leaf Village, players must face Tobi and the Ged\u00f4 Maz\u00f4, with their power being greater for each tailed beast that they stole on their way to this final showdown.\n\nNaruto Shippuden: The Board Game features three levels of play and a large variety of enemies, making each game a unique experience.",

(Value and rank are the same as in Skat and Schafkopf.) Each round players are dealt five cards, replenishing from stock after each trick, with one turned up to indicate trump. The goal in each deal is to accumulate sixty-six trick points, where the card values are A=11, T=10, K=4, Q=3, J=2. The suit led does not need to be followed until the stock is closed or exhausted, at which point suit must be followed, the trick must be won if possible, and you must trump if you cannot follow suit.\n\nDepending on the margin by which a player wins the deal, that player scores 1-3 game points. A player who reaches 7 points wins the whole game. If the other player failed to gain any points in the meantime, the game is a Bummerl of double value. This only matters if playing a match of multiple games, which ends once a player reaches a previously agreed upon number of points. Detailed rules can be found at http://psellos.com/schnapsen/rules.html.\n\nThere also exists a - more complex - variant for three to four players: Bauernschnapsen.\nA non-commercial variant is WOO",

Players erode their mountains with the processes they successfully bid on and acquire. The sediment supplied to the delta becomes the coinage used in the bidding process. Mountain uplifts 1,500 meters per turn until one player reaches 8,000 meters or the ACTIVE UPLIFT SHUTDOWN event card is drawn. Then, its a race to see who can erode their mountain away the fastest. When a player successfully erodes their mountain, the game ends.\n\nThe winner is the player with the most sediment in their delta (after subtracting away any sediment that remains in their mountain)!!!\n\nTo the play the game, you need to print out a copy of the rules, the bidding row, the game cards (the card types include event, process, mountain front, and mountain type), and enough game boards for the number of players that will play. A cool rock and a cup to hold the sediment is also needed. I recommend printing the game materials (except the rules) in color, on 11\" x 17\" cardstock. You will also need to buy a couple boxes of Jujubees (you can eat them while you play), as they are the \"sediment\" used in the game. To make the game, I recommend using a paper cutter, a glue stick, scissors (for minor clean up), and scotch tape.\n\nThe zip file can be downloaded at:\n\nNOTE: EROSION v. 1.0 is now available for download Woohoo! (5/9/08)\nhttp://www.geomorphish.com/o_stuff/o_stuff.html\n\njust click on \"erosion\" at the bottom of the page and the download will start.\n\nMy students and family members are the only ones who have played the game (hence the ultrea high ratings, they are not comparing it to Puerto Rico).

                    "description": "Piquet is a very old trick-taking card game for 2 players, reportedly invented by a M. Piquet during the Court of Charles II. It was well established in a form very similar to that used today in 1650 and remained the most popular game in France for many centuries, similar to Cribbage in the UK.\n\nA 32-card deck ranking from ace to seven in the four suits is used (known universally as a \"Piquet Deck\"). A game consists either of 6 deals called a partie (in the Rubicon version) or to 100 points in the \"Cents\" version. Each player is dealt 12 cards, with 8 left as a talon.\n\nPlay consists of three distinct stages: (1) the exchange, (2) the declarations, and (3) trick play. Winning requires skill at all three.\n\nIn the exchange phase, players may exchange one to five cards with the talon to improve their hand. Each player's discards are visible to them for the remainder of the game. The declaration phase involves revealing melds for points (done in a formalized manner so as to reveal some but not all of one's cards). Declarable combinations include: the most cards of one suit; the longest run in a suit; and sets of the same rank, e.g. 3 kings, 4 aces. The trick phase involves playing out the hand, with no trump. Bonuses include taking most tricks, taking all the tricks, and scoring 30 points before the opponent declares.\n\nThe small deck combined with the large hands combined with the revealing of each other's cards gives Piquet play a different feel than many card games, somewhat more akin to a board game. Part of the strategy of piquet is about controlling information: skillful players carefully determine what they will exchange and declare in order to keep secrets for another phase of the game, at the cost of points in another phase.",

                    "description": "Drive on Damascus recreates the one major campaign between the Allies and Vichy France during WWII. It is an operational game recreating on the battalion level the Allied invasion of Syria and Lebanon in June 1941. This game has been built around two basic situations: the historical invasion and a hypothetical one, covering the chance of German intervention. In both cases it remains a two player game with each player alternately moving his pieces and resolving combat in succession. Whilst the game reproduces the situation that faced the historical commanders, the outcome will depend upon the decisions taken by players; it is perfectly possible to change the course of history.\n\nDrive on Damascus uses point-to-point (dots) movement system. British forces try to preempt an attack from the Vichy French staged in Syria in 1941.\n\nThis game can be run as part of a campaign with O'Connor's Offensive, Hellfire Pass and Bloody Keren (which is where the campaign rules are to be found).\n\nPublished 1981, in The Wargamer Magazine issue #15\n\n\nRe-implements:\n\nSyria, 1941\n\n\n\n\nGame Scale:\nGame Turn: 1 day\nHex: 3.2 miles / 5.15 kilometers\nUnits: Company to Battalion\n\nGame Inventory:\nOne 23 x 32\" full color mapsheet\nOne single-side printed countersheet (260 1/2\" counters)\nOne 12-page Drive on Damascus rulebook (in magazine)\nPlayer will have to provide one 6-sided dice\n\nSolitaire Playability: Medium\nComplexity Level: Medium\nPlayers: 2 or more\nPlaying Time: 4-15 hours",

Campaign game options will allow players to experiment by altering the historical order of battle to determine just what the German possibilities for a victory were. Was the offensive doomed from the start, or could the right combination of planning and military force have secured the objectives?\n\nIn Edelweiss both players will put that question to the test as they struggle to outperform their historical counterparts.",

Each player is a race that has the ability to bend or break certain rules in the game. You will use force, cunning, and diplomacy to win success for your unique form of alien intelligence. Battles are determined through the use of cards in addition to assistance from other players around the table. The winner(s) will be the first player(s) to have FIVE COLONIES on any planets outside his or her home system.\n\nThis is an updated version of the original Cosmic Encounter (1977).\n\nMajor differences between this version and the Eon version:\n\n\nTerminology was changed for many components and rules: Compromise to Negotiate; Consolation to Compensation; Edicts to Artifacts, etc.\nBoth the Eon version and Mayfair Games' version used tokens to represent players' forces. Avalon Hill changed them to plastic ships, and changed the system pieces as well, and the Hyperspace Cone became a Ship carrier.\nMayfair's version used cardback art similar to Eon's, so the two could theoretically be combined. Avalon Hill used all new art on the cards, and the stock is much thinner.",

The game simulates the ferocious battle for the Arnhem Bridge on September 18-21, 1944.\n\nThe game begins with the British holding the area around the bridge, surrounded by the Germans. They try to hold out for as long as they can.\n\nEach full turn covers 8 hours and includes many mini-turns (or impulses). Each impulse, the player can move or fire a small number units. Once moved or fired, the units are \"committed\" and cannot move or fire again until the next turn.\n\nCombat is handled by calculating attack and defense values with each side adding the roll of 2 dice. The difference (if the attacker has the higher total) in final point values is the number of casualty points the defender must lose by retreating or destroying units.\n\nThe games is of relatively low complexity for a wargame and rates 3 (out of 10) on AH's difficulty scale.",

                    "description": "On June 18, 1815, one of the most decisive battles in military history was fought in Belgian fields twenty miles southeast of Brussels. Within a short 100 days, Napoleon, former emperor of France, had returned from exile on the island of Elba, again seized power, quickly assembled an army, and marched to defeat the dispersed British and Prussian armies now preparing to invade France.\n\nNapoleon invaded Belgium on June 15th, defeated the Prussians at the Battle of Ligny on the 16th and after a day of pursuit, faced the British and Dutch army commanded by Wellington. Aided by superb defensive tactics and the timely arrival of Prussian reinforcements, Wellington defeated the French in the great Battle of Waterloo, ending forever the military ambitions of the great Napoleon.\n\nHighlights:\n\n\nMapboard which is a color map of southern Belgium.\n\n\n\nWooden Blocks as counters provide step-reduction and fog of war with no muss or fuss\n\n\n\nTwo or three player game - Napoleon can be played by two or three players. With three, the allied side has two players, one British and one Prussian, and some special rules apply.\n\n\n\nNote that there are essentially three different versions of the game which means that the rules are somewhat different. Key Differences in the various editions:\n1st and 2nd edition had 48 blocks--shorter (60+ min.) play time -- vs.-- 3rd edition has 84 blocks--more accurate division level\n3rd edition had Bl\u00fccher, Napoleon, and Wellington leader blocks that give slight combat and movement bonuses. Although units have increased nearly two fold, the 3rd edition map remains same size, leading to overcrowding.\n4th edition has 56 blocks and a larger map - play time is usually 90 minutes or less.",

                    "description": "Madeira is an island officially discovered early in the 15th century by Portuguese seafarers. Madeira, the Portuguese word for wood, refers to the dense forest that covered its wild, fertile landscape. This, and its strategic position far into the Atlantic Ocean made the island one of the most significant Portuguese discoveries. Madeira served as a \u201claboratory\u201d for what would become the Portuguese Empire.\n\nWheat plantations were the first means for survival on the island. After that, when D. Henrique decided to increase the economy of the Empire, sugar became the core business of Madeira. Once sugar started coming from other places in the world, such as Africa and Brazil, profits from sugar were no longer enough, and production of the very famous Madeira wine became the most important economic product of the island.\n\nPlayers try to adapt themselves to these constraints, working to find better fields for farming the right goods and for obtaining precious wood, essential for erecting new structures in the cities and for building ships. In turn, the ships are crucial for trading in foreign markets, as well as for taking part in new expeditions to discover other countries.\nMadeira has been established just as it was in the original administrative division of the island under 3 captaincies (Funchal, Machico, and Porto Santo), where the ultimate goal is to develop the Island, gaining the most prestige under and for the Portuguese Crown.\n\nThe Crown of Portugal has a series of requests regarding expeditions, urbanization, opening trade routes, increasing wealth, and controlling the guilds on the islands. Three times during the game, the players gain prestige for fulfilling certain requests by the Crown. At two other times, the Crown requests that the islands change the focus of their agriculture due to the changes in the world.\n\nPlayers must carefully choose the correct timing to show their achievements. Too early and you don\u2019t gain as much prestige, too late and you risk someone else stealing the best opportunities. Will you have what it takes to excel in all of these endeavors?\nBeware, wheat may become scarce, money is never enough, the population is hungry, and the shadow of piracy looms large\u2026.",

                    "description": "Faro, Pharaoh, or Farobank, is a late 17th-century French gambling card game descendant of basset, and belongs to the lansquenet and Monte Bank family of games, in that it is played between a banker and several players winning or losing according to the cards turned up matching those already exposed or not.\n\nAlthough not a direct relative of poker, faro was played by the masses alongside its other popular counterpart, due to its fast action, easy-to-learn rules, and better odds than most games of chance. The game of faro is played with only one deck of cards and allows for any number of players.\n\nA game of faro was often called a faro bank. It was played with an entire deck of playing cards. One person was designated the \"banker\" and an indeterminate number of players, known as \"punters\", could be admitted. Chips (called \"checks\") were purchased by the punter from the banker (or house) from which the game originated. Bet values and limits were set by the house. Usual check values were 50 cents to $10 each.\n\nThe faro table was typically oval, covered with green baize, and had a cutout for the banker. A board with a standardized betting layout consisting of all cards of one suit pasted to it in numerical order, called the \"layout\", was placed on top of the table. Traditionally, the suit of spades was used for the layout. Each player laid his stake on one of the 13 cards on the layout. Players could place multiple bets and could bet on multiple cards simultaneously by placing their bet between cards or on specific card edges. Players also had the choice of betting on the \u201chigh card\u201d bar located at the top of the layout.\n\nFaro was popular in eighteenth century Europe and nineteenth century America, particularly on the frontier. It was also often rigged since it did not offer the house a substantial advantage. Once gambling houses became more regulated and cheating was less tolerated, Faro declined. By 1985 it was no longer played in any of the Nevada casinos. It is remembered today mostly by historians and associated with some of its most famous players and dealers, including Casanova, Charles James Fox, Wyatt Earp, and John \"Doc\" Holliday.",

But onboard coal supplies are limited, so each ship's acceleration and maneuvers must be carefully planned. The twists and turns of the river are unknown at the start of the game and are revealed only as ships progress downstream, so captains need to be alert at the wheel and ready to change course.\n\nThis version of Mississippi Queen includes the original base game that won the 1997 Spiel des Jahres as well as The Black Rose expansion that increased the player count to six and included the \"Black Rose\", a black paddle wheeler controlled by whichever player is currently in last place. This boat does not require any coal and can be used to hamper opponents in the lead.\n\nThe game has basic rules that more or less reflect gameplay in the original game, along with advanced rules that introduce elements such as floating logs and sand bars that were included in The Black Rose expansion.",

                    "description": "The theme of this game is building sheep farms. Each farmer (player) owns a farm consisting of hexes radiating out from the center of the board, and whose boundaries (and therefore, sizes) are initially undefined. The placement of fences -- each of which is shared by the two surrounding farms -- defines the boundaries. Some hexes are clearly going to be in certain farms; others will be fought over (either to acquire or avoid!) fiercely.\n\nThe goal is to complete one's own farm by having the fences on both its sides reach the outer edge of the board before the game ends (without which one cannot win), and to have the most enclosed points among all such completed farms (which wins).\n\nThe sheep are on thick cardboard disks, printed on one side with values ranging from 5 (the best) down to -3. One sheep can fit onto each board hex.\n\nOn a turn, a player gets to do one of several actions:\n\n1) place a sheep blindly from the supply face-down onto an empty board space after secretly looking at it; 2) turn up a face-down sheep tile in place (thereby freezing it for the rest of the game); 3) use the cool wooden sheepdog to blindly \"herd\" a face-down sheep from one hex to another, where it is then flipped up and frozen; or 4) lay a fence piece on either of the two fences surrounding his farm.\n\nCertain board hexes, symmetrically distributed, act as multipliers for the sheep that ends up in that space. There are a few special situation rules and a few rules governing fence placement. There are strong elements of bluff and memory in this game.\n\nThe game ends when one player's completed farm is filled with pieces (either face-up or down sheep, or the dog). Whoever has the highest number of points on face-up sheep in his/her farm after applying multipliers is the winner.",

The twist is that now, proper names such as cities or celebrity names will now be allowed. Other twists include \"playing words backwards or playing words unconnected to others on the board,\" Mattel said. The game is a limited edition and will not replace the original Scrabble.\n\nJust like regular Scrabble, each word laid out earns points based on the commonality of the letters used, with certain board spaces giving bonuses. But a word can only be played if it uses at least one already-played tile or adds to an already-played word. This leads to slightly tactical play, as potential words are rejected because they would give an opponent too much access to the better bonus spaces.\n\nNot all precise details are known yet as Scrabble Trickster is due out in July in the U.K. only.",

                    "description": "Twilight Imperium (Fourth Edition) is a game of galactic conquest in which three to six players take on the role of one of seventeen factions vying for galactic domination through military might, political maneuvering, and economic bargaining. Every faction offers a completely different play experience, from the wormhole-hopping Ghosts of Creuss to the Emirates of Hacan, masters of trade and economics. These seventeen races are offered many paths to victory, but only one may sit upon the throne of Mecatol Rex as the new masters of the galaxy.\n\nNo two games of Twilight Imperium are ever identical. At the start of each galactic age, the game board is uniquely and strategically constructed using 51 galaxy tiles that feature everything from lush new planets and supernovas to asteroid fields and gravity rifts. Players are dealt a hand of these tiles and take turns creating the galaxy around Mecatol Rex, the capital planet seated in the center of the board. An ion storm may block your race from progressing through the galaxy while a fortuitously placed gravity rift may protect you from your closest foes. The galaxy is yours to both craft and dominate.\n\nA round of Twilight Imperium begins with players selecting one of eight strategy cards that both determine player order and give their owner a unique strategic action for that round. These may do anything from providing additional command tokens to allowing a player to control trade throughout the galaxy. After these roles are selected, players take turns moving their fleets from system to system, claiming new planets for their empire, and engaging in warfare and trade with other factions. At the end of a turn, players gather in a grand council to pass new laws and agendas, shaking up the game in unpredictable ways.\n\nAfter every player has passed their turn, players move up the victory track by checking to see whether they have completed any objectives throughout the turn and scoring them. Objectives are determined by setting up ten public objective cards at the start of each game, then gradually revealing them with every round. Every player also chooses between two random secret objectives at the start of the game, providing victory points achievable only by the holder of that objective. These objectives can be anything from researching new technologies to taking your neighbor's home system. At the end of every turn, a player can claim one public objective and one secret objective. As play continues, more of these objectives are revealed and more secret objectives are dealt out, giving players dynamically changing goals throughout the game. Play continues until a player reaches ten victory points.\n\n\u2014description from the publisher",

Scarred by the flames of betrayal, Rex is a specter of a fallen empire and of ages long forgotten, yet it remains an object of reverence-and desire-in a galaxy of conflict and uncertainty.\n\nOnce, the great city that spanned its surface was the pinnacle of civilization. Today, Mecatol City is naught but a blasted shell of its former glory, a grim respite in the toxic Sea of Desolation that covers the majority of the planet.\n\nEven so, its parabolic history of decadence and destruction does little to deter those who would seek to harness its power. The Winaaran custodians who dwell within the remnants of the city maintain what is left of the former capital, waiting for one of the Great Races to step forward and take up the mantle of the former Emperors.\n\nBut who among the races of the galaxy could fill the void left by the Lazax? To lay claim to the throne is a destiny sought by many, yet the shadows of the past serve as a grim warning to those who would follow in their footsteps...\n\nFor two decades, Twilight Imperium has thrilled gamers with its grand storytelling and tactical strategy. Now players can explore the next step in the Twilight Imperium Legacy with Twilight Imperium Fourth Edition, an epic game of galactic conquest for three to six players.\n\nEach player takes command of one of seventeen unique civilizations to compete for interstellar supremacy through warfare, trade, uncertain allegiances, and political dominance. Every faction offers a completely different play experience, from the wormhole-hopping Ghosts of Creuss to the Emiratates of Hacan, the masters of trade. All of these races have many paths to victory, but only one will sit upon the throne of Mecatol Rex as the new masters of the galaxy.",

Cards represent prows and poops, and everything in between --missile launchers, laser turrets, shuttles...Special \"prizes\" appear as pairs of cards; should you be lucky enough to draw both halves and play them side by side, it is worth more. Each of these prizes is worth even more if played in the same starship as a specific accompanying card.\n\nAt any point, you have to choose between closing a starship (and scoring) or building it up some more. In addition, complete starships can attack the other player's starships...\n\nThere is little control in this game, as the players simply draw then place cards - but there's still some reasonable amount of strategy in the placements. The simplicity makes it accessible to children, whilst it remains enjoyable by adults as a light, quick game.",
